The U-M Diabetes Health Fair is open from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm at the Sheraton Ann Arbor Hotel at 3200 Boardwalk, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 (I-94 State Street exit 177).

The U-M Diabetes Health Fair will have six types of free health screenings, dozens of information tables, and free presentations on diabetes topics. New this year, a Crafts Corner for kids will be offered (parents must attend with their child). The eventäó»s master of ceremonies is Brandon Roux, WDIV-TV Channel 4 meteorologist (photo left), who has type 1 diabetes (formerly called juvenile diabetes).

The changing political economy of food production and consumption and its role in reshaping social identities and agrarian environments remains remarkably understudied. This lecture outlines the preliminary contours of a project that attempts to analyze some of these shifts through a selective discussion of changing food practices in post-Independence western India. It delineates the widening circuits of food as a commodity form within the home and outside, spanned by the growth of processed foods and practices of 'eating out'. It outlines the changing signification of food practices for different social groups, and considers some potential health and ecological implications arising from the transformation. It makes the case for focused attention on food as a way of understanding social change in India.",Map School of Social Work Building - 1644,['2013-09-17 16:00'],"['Food', 'India', 'Sociology']",T

In this presentation, Professor Zou will delve into Du Liniangäó»s character, a woman who lived under the extremely strict constraint on her living space and spiritual world, both from ideological pressure and constraints on her body. Professor Zou explained that Du Liniang is not a äóìbeingäóù because she is alienated from the real word until she enters a condition of boundless life (death) and starts to have a song of her own, a song that signifies äóìbeing.äóù *Image: Du Liniang and her äóìbeingäóù in three zones Biography ZOU Yuanjiang is Professor of Philosophy and a supervisor of doctoral degree candidates at Wuhan University.

32789,Mei Lanfang and Twentieth Century Peking Opera: Transcultural Exchanges,"Mei Lanfangäó»s visit and performances abroad brought him to Japan in 1919, to the United States in 1930, and to the Soviet Union in 1935. While these performances helped introduce Peking Opera abroad and earned Mei Lanfang universal praise and admiration, they more importantly gave Peking opera an opportunity to highlight, for international audiences, its new cultural identity, to present its art as a modern aesthetic system, and to project its claim to historical authenticity. The Peking opera presented there was not a form preserved from time immemorial, but the outcome of an intense ideological debate among the younger generation of the cultural elite within China as to the validity of traditional Chinese theater with the most radical opinion denouncing Peking opera as the dregs of traditional society, bond up with everything dispicable of the old social order and values, and their opponents boldly claiming the modern relevancy of the form by actively engaging with international performing arts as present in Europe, the US and Japan. Mei Lanfangäó»s carefully prepared international tours with the radically reformed Peking opera were to decide this debate and the domestic fate of genre altogether through international recognition by audiences that included foreign cultural elite and much of the international avant-garde. In this sense, these tours were the catalyst and the crowning glory of the modernization of the genre. The talk will explore these tours in the context of the shifting self- definition, self-narration and self-historization of Peking opera in its struggle to become Chinaäó»s äóìnational opera.äóù *Image:äóìMei Lan-fang, Chinaäó»s Greatest Actor Here for His American Premiere.äóù Drawing, 1930.

19563,Hal Korn - Is making it to college enough,"Is making it to college enough? Masculinities, stress, and success among black college men (additional description below) Daphne C. Watkins, PhD Asst. Professor in Social Work and Psychiatry, Faculty Associate, Research Center for Group Dynamics, Institute for Social Research Continuing Education credits for Social Workers are available; light refreshments will be provided. FREE! Abstract: College-aged black men experience higher levels of psychological distress due to their exposure to a greater frequency and severity of stress compared to other groups. For example, for more than a decade, mental health professionals have been concerned about the disproportionate increase in suicide among adolescent and young adult black males, because males account for 80% of the suicides among blacks. The frequency and severity of psychosocial stressors are exacerbated by other socio-demographic factors (i.e., age, household income, marital status, education level) that can influence the emotional and psychological health of black men. Likewise, studies have chronicled the psychological distress of young black men as a result of discrimination, negative attitudes toward the criminal justice system, racial and cultural identity, depression, violence, and issues involving their masculine gender norms. Research on black men in college is conflicting, as many studies underscore the benefits of educational achievement, while others focus on the challenges associated with gaining social capital and äóìupward mobility.äóù In this presentation, Professor Daphne C. Watkins (UM Social Work and Psychiatry) will discuss her research on young black men, masculinities, and how this influences their stress and ability to succeed. She will also discuss future directions in this area, such as her new Young black men, masculinities, and mental health (YBMen) project.",Map Michigan Union - Anderson Room of the Michigan Union,['2014-10-31 10:30'],"['African american', 'Alumni', 'Athletics', 'Detroit', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Food', 'Free', 'Greek life', 'Social justice']",T

Stewart Gordon is an Independent Scholar long associated with the Center for South Asian Studies at the University of Michigan.

Gordon has photographed antiquities in Cambodia and Paleolithic cave paintings in India and has served as a consultant for the History Channel, the Discovery Channel, the Walt Disney Company and the American Queen steamboat. He writes regularly for Aramco World magazine. Gordon has received many awards including Woodrow Wilson and Fulbright fellowships and an Earhart Foundation writing grant.

A benefit for the Michigan Marriage Challenge, presented by the Jim Toy Community Center will be held on Sunday, February 23, 2014 at 1pm at The ARK, 316 S. Main, Ann Arbor, MI, 734-761-1800. Tickets: $250 Benefactor - reserved seating house floor front & center, $100 Supporters - reserved seating house center and $25 General Admission. All of the artists and the attorneys are donating their time to help raise critically needed funds. This benefit is an opportunity for supporters of marriage equality to help make it a reality. Emceed by U of M Professor Holly Hughes, the evening will feature artists such as singer songwriter Vienna Teng (viennateng.com/), folk duo Nervous But Excited in a greatly anticipated re-union (nervousbutexcited.com), the Dueling Divas Callie McKee and Robby Griswold of Arbor Opera Theatre, and many others. Help the DeBoer-Rowse Family: Hazel Park lesbian couple April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse are suing the state of Michigan for the right to legally wed and thereby co-adopt their three kids. Their case represents a direct, effective and rapid means of securing marriage equality in Michigan. The state licensed the two nurses as a couple to serve as foster parents of their three special needs children, but Michigan law allows only legally married couples to jointly adopt children. This civil right, afforded all others in Michigan, is not available to the DeBoer-Rowse family due to Michiganäó»s constitutional ban on the state recognizing marriages of same-gender couples. Because they are prohibited by law to adopt jointly, Rowse adopted their two sons, and DeBoer their daughter. The law firm Nessel and Kessel is arguing the DeBoer-Rowse familyäó»s case pro bono; however, bringing in expert witnesses to demonstrate to the court that same-gender couples are fit parents is expensive. The lawyers estimate the witnesses and other legal expenses could cost a combined quarter of a million dollars at a minimum. Federal Judge Bernard A. Friedman, of the Eastern District of Michigan, will begin hearing evidence in DeBoer v. Snyder in late February.","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.

18808,EEB Thursday Seminar Series,"The formal discussion of how animals appear to be designed to function in their environment started over 200 years ago when William Paley described how animals were adapted to their environment by an omnipotent designer. The modern environment that wild animals face is changing dramatically due to human activities. Over 50 years ago, Richard Levins described adaptive phenotypic plasticity as an evolutionary strategy that animals could use to adapt to such changing environments. My research focuses on understanding the evolutionary strategies and physiological mechanisms by which real animals in real places adapt to changing environments. In this seminar, I provide an overview of my past, current, and future research in wild animals. I show that wild red squirrels live in an environment where natural selection on offspring phenotype fluctuates across years but that maternal stress responses to cues of density-mediated selection cause adaptive developmental plasticity in offspring phenotype that allows them to cope with this variable environment. Secondly, I show how the hormonal mediation of broad patterns of variation in mammalian life histories may mediate but also constrain adaptive life history plasticity to a changing environment. Third, I show how individual variation and plasticity in pro-social (cooperative) behavior in free-living meerkats may be caused by individual differences in stress physiology such that some individuals are constrained to exhibit either a high or low level of pro-social behavior regardless of changes in their social environment. Overall, these three examples of my research highlight how studying questions at the interface of ecology, evolution, and physiology can lead to new insights into the role of phenotypic plasticity in facilitating and constraining contemporary adaptation to altered environments.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1210,['2014-10-02 16:00'],['Ecology & biology'],F

Archigram operated as an experimental think-tank. The practice produced a multitude of products that represented a shift in how architectural practice is considered including a magazine, projects, models, exhibitions and proposals. This shift in architectural practice focused on prioritizing processes and responsive structures for living. Influenced by popular culture and responding to the proliferation of technological advances at the time, as well as recognizing the increasing social and political discontent, Archigramäó»s production emphasized mobility and flexibility in ways that continue to have currency today. At Archigram, Crompton was an enthusiast of gadgets, machines, techniques and systems, and invented the provocative äóìthings that go bang in the nightäóù projects. He orchestrated the Archigram Archives in 1975 when the practice ended. With Ron Herron, Crompton was responsible for the assembly and design of the major exhibition äóìArchigram: Experimental Architecture 1961-74,äóù which opened in Vienna in 1994. He shepherded the Archigram Exhibition around Europe, Asia and North America. Archigram was awarded the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture by the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2002. Outside of Archigram, Crompton had a strong involvement with the Architectural Association School since 1965 where he taught for over thirty years. More recently, he taught masters courses in Architecture and Urban Design at The Bartlett School of Architecture and frequently lectures in the U.S. and Europe. Exhibition opening reception for Crompton's exhibition, ""Archigram,"" will immediately follow at the Liberty Research Annex (305 W.

I will mainly discuss the application of this idea in optical coherence tomography (OCT) where we have replaced complicated hardware with physics-based algorithms to produce a high-resolution 3-d imaging system with infinite depth of field in a compact form factor.

27042,Developmental Area Brown Bag - Speech segmentation in typically developing children and children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: an MEG study/Trajectories of Smoking Over the Transition to Retirement,".ABSTRACT: Speech segmentation, or identifying syllables and words in a continuous linguistic stream, is foundational for language acquisition. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the neural mechanisms that support childrenäó»s ability to identify syllabic units in a continuous linguistic stream and how these mechanisms might be affected by neurodevelopmental impairments in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Although ASD is characterized by delays in language acquisition, it is generally unknown what learning mechanisms lead to impaired language in ASD. Typically developing children are able to utilize regularities in speech (e.g. transitional probabilities, TP) in order to detect various aspects of phonotactics and syntactic rules. However, it is not established whether children with ASD can also take advantage of statistical regularities in naturally spoken language. The present study investigated the neuro-cognitive mechanism of speech segmentation by comparing typically developing children to children with ASD using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) neuroimaging during a language-based statistical learning paradigm. We investigated learning ability and concurrent brain activation while 15 ASD children and 14 healthy controls (ages 8-12) listened to three repetitions of a 2-minute passage in a new language (Italian). Italian passages included target words with high (TP = 1.0; HTP) and low (TP = 0.33; LTP) internal predictability between syllables. Behavioral testing at the end of the session revealed that typically developing children outperformed children with ASD on both the HTP (t(24) = 3.00, p < 0.01) and LTP (t(26) = 4.39, p < 0.001) target words. MEG measures of event related brain responses indicate learning differences between the groups in the left primary auditory cortex, left superior temporal gyrus, and the left inferior frontal gyrus. Interestingly, learning performance across the groups appeared to be a better predictor of brain response to target words than did the developmental profile of the children. Our findings contribute new insights to better understanding the developing brain and provide implications for language and communication impairments observed in ASD. BIO: Neelima is a third year PhD candidate in the Developmental program. She graduated from Michigan State University in 2013 with a B.S. in Psychology and a specialization in Cognitive Science. In general, her area of research examines the underlying brain mechanisms that support language acquisition in infants and children, and the various trajectories of language development over the course of the human lifespan (e.g. bilingualism, language impairments). Her focus is on the use of multimodal neuroimaging techniques and methodologies applied to developmental populations. Today, she will be presenting on her 619 project. ABSTRACT: Retirement is an important life transition that may motivate older adults to make significant changes to their health behaviors, such as quitting smoking. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study of US adults over age 50, to examine the different trajectories of smoking over the transition to retirement. We then determine the role of a recent hospitalization in differentiating between individuals who continue to smoke from those who quit during the retirement transition. Using a group-based trajectory approach, we identified five distinct trajectories of smoking over the transition to retirement. Our results suggest that hospitalizations that occur close to retirement may be interpreted differently from those that occur during the working years and may be more likely to promote health behavior change. In conclusion, there is no single trajectory that characterizes the influence of retirement on smoking behavior. Healthcare professionals should consider increasing the salience of upcoming life transitions like retirement when counseling older adults on smoking cessation. BIO: Jennifer Sun is a joint MD/PhD student at the University of Michigan who is currently pursuing her PhD in Developmental Psychology. Her advisors are Dr. Jacqui Smith and Dr. Toni Antonucci, and her research interests revolve around how psychosocial factors affect chronic disease outcomes and healthcare utilization among older adults. She hopes to pursue a career in primary care and incorporate more behavioral interventions into clinical practice. Today, she will be presenting some recent work on trajectories of smoking over the transition to retirement.",Map East Hall - 4464 East Hall,['2016-02-15 12:00'],['Brown bag'],F

In this daylong mix of presentations, panels, and conversations, weäó»ll discuss how to disentangle luck from skill. Weäó»ll explore whether todayäó»s successful individuals and organizations are truly great or have they serendipitously lit upon strategies or actions that provide temporary advantages.

Are investment bankers more dependent on skill than venture capitalists? Weäó»ll also touch on streaks. Fifty-six games in a row cannot be luck. Or can it? And, finally, weäó»ll try to unpack the effects of the increasing complexity and rates of change in the economic, political, social, and even biological worlds on the returns to skill.

27313,CSAS Lecture Series | The Growth of the Himalaya and the Tibetan Plateau and the Effect of High Terrain on the Indian Monsoon,"Peter Molnar obtained a bacheloräó»s degree in Physics in 1965 from Oberlin College and Ph.D. in geology in 1970 from Columbia University, with a thesis in earthquake seismology. His initial work addressed aspects of plate tectonics. Following a 2-year post-doc at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and 4 months as an exchange scientist in the USSR studying earthquake prediction, he began an assistant professorship at MIT, where he turned his attention to the processes by which continents deform on a large scale and in particular how mountain ranges form. After 12 years of being dissatisfied with his teaching, he quit and returned to the life of a post-doc. In 2000, eager to change the direction of his research to include the study of how large-scale geodynamic processes have affected climate on geologic time scales, he moved to the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Colorado and became a fellow in the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES). Peter Molnaräó»s research focuses largely on these two questions: (1) how large-scale geodynamics cause deformation of the Earthäó»s crust, including earthquakes and the building of mountain ranges, and (2) how shifting continents, emergence of islands, growth of mountains, etc. affect climate on geologic time scales. His work has included fieldwork in remote parts of the world, and numerical calculations of processes that obey rules of fluid mechanics, but he is incompetent, and unwelcome, in a laboratory. He teaches a graduate seminar in äóìTectonics and Climate,äóù among other courses.",Map School of Social Work Building - 1636,['2016-03-11 16:00'],['Lecture'],F

16907,"Todd Cronan Lecture, ""The Medium Has No Message: The (Non)Politics of Medium from Kandinsky to Benjamin""","Does the medium have a message? Is there a deep connection between media and subjectivity? Does the ubiquity of images that seemingly defines modernity constitute or transform our consciousness? Do the media that we use shape or even determine our politics? For a wide range of modernists and (for most) postmodernists the connection is assumed, a given. Looking at a foundational moment of media theoryäóñthe moment of Kandinskyäó»s first abstractions to Benjaminäó»s theory of mechanical reproductionäóñI show how a growing pessimism about human agency finds its resolution in a utopian optimism about technologyäó»s effects (even or especially when that technology is the object of critique). I will show what is mistaken about correlating media and subjectivity. I will also suggest how this now canonized mistake can and should be replaced with something better. Todd Cronan is Assistant Professor of art history at Emory University, where his research centers on twentieth-century art and art theory with particular emphasis on problems around expression, intention, affect, form and meaning. He is the author of Against Affective Formalism: Matisse, Bergson, Modernism (Univ. of Minnesota Press, 2013) and Matisse (Phaidon, 2014). His articles have appeared in the New German Critique, British Journal of the History of Philosophy, Design and Culture, Zetischrift fur Kunstgeschichte, qui parle and nonsite.org and he serves on the editorial board of nonsite.org.

28565,Transduction and Medial Conversion: LineäóîLetteräóîTrace,"In the spring of 2008, the First Sounds Initiative made international headlines by releasing digitally recovered audio from a recording dated April 9, 1860, seventeen years before Thomas Edison invented his phonograph. The haunting vocal rendition of äóìAu Clair de la Luneäóù had been recorded by í_douard-Lí©on Scott de Martinville on the phonautograph, an instrument he had designed to trace airborne sound vibrations onto soot-blackened sheets of paper using an artificial eardrum. His goal in transducing sounds was to convert them into graphical texts people would access just as they did other äóìwritingsäóù: namely, by exposing them to light and looking at them. By playing back Scottäó»s phonautograms as sound, we arguably subverted his original intentions, but at the same time we made it possible for listeners to experience his work in a newly enlightening and enchanting way. Drawing on this and other recent cases of media being äóìplayedäóù against the grain, Iäó»ll explore how novel approaches to the history and practice of transduction can challenge received wisdom about what counts as historical audio and video. Patrick Feaster is a specialist in the history, culture, and preservation of early time-based media. A three-time Grammy nominee, co-founder of the First Sounds Initiative, and current President of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections, he has been actively involved in locating, identifying, and contextualizing many of the world's oldest sound recordings and has pioneered a number of digital processing strategies for bringing historical sources to life as audio, video, and 3D imagery. He is the author of Pictures of Sound: One Thousand Years of Educed Audio, 980-1980, as well as various album notes and articles about the history and theory of phonography. He received his doctorate in Folklore and Ethnomusicology in 2007 from Indiana University Bloomington, where he is now Media Preservation Specialist for the Media Digitization and Preservation Initiative.","Map 202 S.

With stark aesthetic detail and meticulous documentation, Prison Obscura builds the case that Americans must come face to face with these images and imaging technologies both to grasp the cancerous proliferation of the U.S. prison system and to connect with those it confines.

33500,"Social, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics (SBEE)","Abstract: We study markets for sensitive personal information. An agent wants to communicate with another party but any revealed information can be intercepted and sold to a third party whose reaction harms the agent. The market for information induces an adverse sorting effect, allocating the information to those types of third parties who harm the agent most. In equilibrium, this limits information transmission by the agent, but never fully deters it. We also consider agents who naively provide information to the market. Their presence renders traded information more valuable and, thus, harms sophisticated agents by increasing the third partyäó»s demand for information. Half-baked regulatory interventions may hurt naive agents without helping sophisticated agents. Comparing monopoly and oligopoly markets, we find that oligopoly is often better for the agent: it requires a higher value of traded information and therefore has to grant the agent more privacy.",Map North Quad - 3100 (Ehrlicher Room),['2016-09-12 15:30'],"['Economics', 'Seminar']",F

And all over the Southeast, Mipso has been busy playing raucously fun live shows that veer from up-tempo original melodies to madcap acoustic covers of Michael Jackson.

12863,Civic Engagement and Performance Management,"Abstract äóìThe legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do, for themselves in their separate and individual capacities.äóùŒù - Abraham Lincoln Government exists to produce positive outcomes in the community and those outcomes are äóìco-producedäóùŒù by government and citizens working together. Every citizen has political responsibilities since improvements in government performance only occur as the result of a series of political acts. In the 21st Century, performance management means partnering with citizens to produce results. Nothing else works. Weäó»ll address some of the aspects of this co-production and how it is working across America, including community economic development, place making and the tools and techniques of deliberative democracy. Dr. Mark Funkhouser is the Director of the Governing Institute. Prior to that, he was mayor of Kansas City, Missouri from 2007 to 2011. Funkhouser was the first government professional ever elected by Kansas Citizens to serve as their mayor. During his controversial term he relied heavily on his experience and training in public finance to lead the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. When he left office, the cityäó»s finances were in the best shape they had been in over a decade, a feat accomplished in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression. Funkhouser began his career as a guard at George Junior Republic, a youth corrections facility in Grove City, Pennsylvania. He went on to work as a rehabilitation counselor with the Pennsylvania State Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation and then as an assistant professor at Salem College in Salem, West Virginia, teaching social work and sociology. In 1978 he began a career as a performance auditor, first in Tennessee state government and then for the City of Kansas City, where he served as City Auditor from 1988 until 2006. Under his leadership, the City Auditoräó»s Office won the Knighton Award for outstanding auditing in 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2004. GOVERNING recognized Funkhouser as one of its Public Officials of the Year in 2003. While he was the City Auditor, Funkhouser also taught courses in public budgeting, program evaluation, policy analysis, public finance and related topics in the MPA programs of the University of Kansas and the University of Missouri at Kansas City. He has written extensively about government performance and accountability and spoken at numerous seminars and workshops throughout the world. His book, Honest, Competent Government, was the first global study of performance auditing. In addition, he has served on the editorial boards of several publications including the American Review of Public Administration and the Journal of Government Financial Management. Funkhouseräó»s academic training includes a bacheloräó»s degree in political science from Thiel College, a masteräó»s degree in social work from West Virginia University, an MBA in accounting and finance from Tennessee State University, and an interdisciplinary PhD in public administration and sociology from the University of Missouri at Kansas City.

35464,Screening/Q&A: Composed,"Through the lens of professional classical musicians, Composed explores the many ways we experience and can address performance anxiety. Faced with the judgment of peers, audience, conductors, and worst of all themselves, these musicians spend years trying to understand and overcome the physical and mental manifestations of their anxiety. Through their stories, we learn valuable lessons learned over a lifetime of professional performance; and we find that we are not alone in our quest to overcome the fear of failure and embarrassment. For anyone wanting to feel strength over fear and compassion over judgment, or simply seeking a closer look at anxiety and what makes us tick, Composed opens the door to a world of high stakes, high pressure, and peak performing. Following the screening a Q&A will be held with the filmäó»s director John Beder, Julie Nagel (psychoanalyst, psychologist, pianist, and author of ""Melodies of the Mind""), Louis Nagel (pianist and Emeritus Professor of Piano and Piano Literature), and Emily Hyssong (CAPS Counsellor).",Map Earl V.

29781,John Dinkeloo Memorial Lecture: David Adjaye,"The University of Michigan's Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning presents...the John Dinkeloo Memorial Lecture by David Adjaye. David Adjaye OBE is recognized as a leading architect of his generation. Adjaye was born in Tanzania to Ghanaian parents and his influences range from contemporary art, music and science to African art forms and the civic life of cities. In 1994 he set up his first office, where his ingenious use of materials and his sculptural ability established him as an architect with an artistäó»s sensibility and vision. He reformed his studio as Adjaye Associates in 2000 and immediately won several prestigious commissions. In Oslo he designed the Nobel Peace Centre in the shell of a disused railway station (completed in 2005). In London his design for the Whitechapel Idea Store pioneered a new approach to the provision of information services (2005). Later projects in London included the Stephen Lawrence Centre, with teaching and community spaces (2007), Rivington Place, an exhibition venue and resource centre (2007), and the Bernie Grant Centre for the performing arts (2007). Adjaye Associatesäó» largest completed project to date is the Œ£160 million Moscow School of Management Skolkovo (2010). Adjaye Associates now has four international offices, with projects throughout the world. These include a shopping and cultural complex in Beirut (ongoing), a concept store in Lagos (2014), a new headquarters building for the International Finance Corporation in Dakar (ongoing) and a hospital in Rwanda (ongoing). Adjaye frequently collaborates with contemporary artists on art and installation projects. Examples include The Upper Room, with thirteen paintings by Chris Ofili (2002), Within Reach, a second installation with Ofili in the British pavilion at the Venice Biennale (2003), and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Art for the 21st Century Pavilion that was designed to show a projection work by Olafur Eliasson, Your Black Horizon, at the 2005 Venice Biennale. The Upper Room is now in the permanent collection of Tate Britain. Adjaye is now collaborating with Okwui Enwezor on the design of the forthcoming 56th Venice Art Biennale. Adjaye has taught at the Royal College of Art, where he had previously studied, and at the Architectural Association School in London, and has held distinguished professorships at the universities of Pennsylvania, Yale and Princeton. He is currently the John C. Portman Design Critic in Architecture at Harvard. He was awarded the OBE for services to architecture in 2007, received the Design Miami/ Year of the Artist title in 2011, the Wall Street Journal Innovator Award in 2013 and the W.E.B. Du Bois medal from Harvard University. The material from Adjayeäó»s ten-year study of the capital cities of Africa was shown in Urban Africa, an exhibition at the Design Museum, London (2010) and published as African Metropolitan Architecture (New York, 2011, and as Adjaye Africa Architecture, London, 2011). He was the artistic director of GEO-graphics: A map of art practices in Africa, past and present, a major exhibition at the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels (2010). The last exhibition of his architectural work, David Adjaye: Output, was held at Gallery MA, Tokyo (2010) and he is now collaborating with Haus der Kunst in Munich and the Art Institute of Chicago on a comprehensive retrospective exhibition, which will open in 2015. The John Dinkeloo Memorial Lecture was established to recognize John Dinkeloo's extraordinary contributions to architecture, to honor his distinguished professional work and to pay tribute to this highly respected alumnus of the Architecture Program at the University of Michigan.

Ever since they started singing together on the street corners, farmers' markets, and subway stations of New York City, strangers and neighbors come to rejoice in the sound, and there is no divide between performer and spectator. Paste describes their sound this way: ""Dusty acoustic guitars, wailing fiddles and weeping accordions, with a woozy-yet-skintight rhythm section-- and topped off with burr-edged vocals that sound like they've been soaked in a Mason jar for generationsäóñit's the type of music that blurs the line between past and present so thoroughly, and so deftly, that time feels irrelevant."" Hurray for the Riff Raff is Alynda lee Segarra, a 25 year old Puerto Rican from the Bronx. After leaving home at an early age to travel the country, she eventually settled in New Orleans where she began to perform and record with a revolving cast of musicians. Alynda and her longtime gunslinger on fiddle, Yosi Perlstein, met up with a young honky-tonk band called the Tumbleweeds, just as Alynda began to expand her musical palette to include country, rock 'n' roll, pop, and soul. In the tradition of Bob Dylan with Band and Neil Young with Crazy Horse, Alynda and Yosi recruited the Tumbleweeds to be their touring band, drastically altering the sound of Hurray for the Riff Raff. From the swamp pop of äóìLittle Black StaräóùŒù to the classic country of äóìLook Out Mama,äóùŒù to the psychedelia of äóìOde to John and YokoäóùŒù and even the surf rock of äóìLake of Fire,"" Hurray for the Riff Raff covers a wide array of musical ground, with every song unified by Alyndaäó»s soulful vocals and expert songwriting.

To fill this gap, we take a variety of approaches to investigate how meiotic processes evolve in plants. Among others, we cloned the ameiotic 1 gene in maize, which is responsible for the switch from mitotic cell division to meiosis in maize, and found that the mechanism of meiosis initiation differs not only between fungi, mammals, and plants but also between monocot and dicot plants. We also studied sequence variation in several meiotic recombination genes in maize and its wild ancestor teosinte and discovered that a large fraction of these genes were targets of positive selection during maize domestication and subsequent breeding. These results suggest that even though meiosis is an ancient and conserved process some meiotic genes show rapid evolution.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1210,['2010-09-16 16:00'],[],F

A powerful tool to understand this matter is to use the high momentum quarks and gluons generated in hard scattering processes in the earliest stages of the nuclear collision as probes of the matter at later times. These measurements use modifications to the jet rates and properties induced by the scattering of the probes off the constituents of the matter to infer the nature of the interactions and constrain the properties of the matter. This talk will describe the new measurements at 5 TeV collision energy of jets and their properties in the ATLAS detector in lead-lead collisions as well proton-proton and proton-lead collisions which provide a baseline for the lead-lead measurements.,Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-06 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']",F

The key idea involves ""lifting"" elements in the open orbit for the action of G on V to elements in the minimal nonzero orbit of another prehomogeneous vector space (G',V').

38380,Financial/Actuarial Mathematics,We solve the martingale optimal transport problem for cost functionals represented by optimal stopping problems. The measure-valued martingale approach developed in ArXiv: 1507.02651 allows us to obtain an equivalent infinite-dimensional controller-stopper problem. We use the stochastic Perron's method and characterize the finite dimensional approximation as a viscosity solution to the corresponding HJB equation. It turns out that this solution is the concave envelope of the cost function with respect to the atoms of the terminal law. We demonstrate the results by finding explicit solutions for a class of cost functions. Joint work with Erhan Bayraktar (UM) and Alex Cox (Bath).

He played the cello and switched to the guitar, then to the blues, after a DJ uncle introduced him to the likes of T-Bone Walker and Snooks Eaglin. The All Music Guide's J. Poet wrote that Seth ""uses the blues as a backbone for tunes that will equally please roots, Americana, folk, pop, and blues fans. He's a fine guitarist, but his playing never calls attention to itself; it's always placed in service of the song and the lyrics crackle with insight and subtle wit.""

4068,Edge compartmental infectious disease models,"The structure of social interactions along which disease spreads can be represented using a network. When we investigate disease spreading in a network we find that many of the assumptions of mass action mixing fail. Individuals with many contacts tend to become infected earlier, and in turn infect more individuals, leading to faster initial growth. However, the remaining population has fewer contacts than average, and so the growth rate decreases more rapidly and the epidemic eventually dies out sooner than mass action predicts. Unfortunately mathematical models of infectious disease tend to require (arbitrarily) many differential equations. Recent work by Erik Volz (SIR dynamics in random networks with heterogeneous connectivity, JMB 2008) showed that it is possible to capture the dynamics exactly with a low-dimensional system. My own work (A note on a paper by Erik Volz: SIR dynamics in random networks, JMB 2010) has shown that it is possible to simplify this derivation and in so doing arrive at an even simpler system. Our more recent unpublished work simplifies the derivation further, and allows easy generalization to a wide range of (SI or SIR) diseases and population structures, including populations whose contacts change in time. The key simplification comes from focusing our attention to the fraction of edges that connect to susceptible, infected, or recovered individuals rather than the fraction of the population with given infection status. I will show how to derive these systems and compare the resulting predictions with simulation.",Map West Hall - 335,['2010-10-25 14:30'],[],F

If these changes were implemented, it would also eliminate the existing social injustice against men who have sex with men.One way in which we are raising awareness of this policy is through sponsor drives, which are blood drives in which an ineligible donor brings someone who is eligible to donate on their behalf. When every presenting donor is accompanied by an ineligible individual, the potential to collect twice as many pints of blood is visually demonstrated.

These direct impacts of human activities on forests interact with other anthropogenic drivers such as climate variability to affect the capacity of forests to provide ecosystem services.

The project will feature a video installation in the IH gallery, an interactive portrait exhibition in GalleryDAAS, and a video screening of the award winning film, Chameleon Street. The screenings will be held at the Institute of the Humanities and at the Charles Wright Museum in Detroit, MI. About the project: The Crown: Shani Peters and Contemporary Construction of Self in America is a series of projects by artist Shani Peters that will examine the socially acceptable yet complicated concept of Black pride and success. Crowns, symbolic of kings and queens, and conferred on any number of Black popular culture figures from James Brown to Biggie, are also symbols for systems of inequitably distributed resources and injustice. This multi-part projectäóîwhich includes two exhibitions, a film screening, and a panel discussionäóîasks the question: what does it mean to acknowledge the need for these forms of pride and success while recognizing their problems? It further complicates the question with a consideration of the similar celebration and pride that comes from attaining degrees of higher education which offer obvious opportunities, yet can alienate students of African descent from their origins. The artist asks, how do Black people register these complicated elements in ways that allow them to move progressively through western power structures towards futures that reflect their right to dignity and self-determination?

She became an expert in seeing the world the way an architect sees it. But as a progressive architectural thinker, Henryäó»s inspiration has been to deconstruct that vision, to äóìunseeäóù the very forms and representations that constitute an architectäó»s basic language. Through speculative experiments and conceptual drawings Henry discovers in static architectural details an unsettling range of figurative expression, including, for example, the way the profiles of roof eaves resemble human heads. Wallpaper, with its ability to mask, transform, or animate a space, is also a prominent element in her work. Her projects explore how these features animate our subjective experienceäóîwhat she calls our äóìshifting fantasiesäóùäóîof architectural space.

And on top of that, he's a tall tale teller of the first order, with a dry sense of humor that would be reason enough in itself to come to one of his concerts. Says Newsday: ""Unlike Richard Thompson or Robert Fripp, in whose league he belongs, Legg seems never to have been seduced by rock. But unlike Leo Kottke or Ry Cooder, whom he also occasionally resembles, Legg is an adventurer, not an archivist."" He is, quite simply, one of the greatest guitarists in the world, and perhaps the very least heralded among that group.","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.
