28194,CSAS Lecture Series,"Speaker: Stewart Gordon Dr. Gordon will reflect on his three recent books on World History (When Asia was the World, History of the World in Sixteen Shipwrecks, and Shackles of Iron: Slavery Beyond the Atlantic World). Eight months in India on a Fulbright last year brought into perspective not just the intense politics of history and culture at this juncture but also the very real limitations of his own research on India, based as it is on scribal documents. In many public lectures he connected India with the larger physical and intellectual world, exploring themes of gender, environment, science and systems of honor. He will discuss what he saw and heard and what it might mean for the field of South Asian Studies. Stewart Gordon is an Independent Scholar long associated with the Center for South Asian Studies at the University of Michigan. He has rambled by bus across Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, struggled up Inca paths in Peru and boated up the Mekong and the Mississippi. Gordon has photographed antiquities in Cambodia and Paleolithic cave paintings in India and has served as a consultant for the History Channel, the Discovery Channel, the Walt Disney Company and the American Queen steamboat. He writes regularly for Aramco World magazine. Gordon has received many awards including Woodrow Wilson and Fulbright fellowships and an Earhart Foundation writing grant. His scholarly output includes more than two dozen articles and four books on Indian history, all based on archival work. His “When Asia was the World”, became a bestseller and has been translated into seven languages.

In partnership with the Jim Toy Community Center, the artists have given their time and talent to raise critically needed funds for the DeBoer-Rowse Family to legally co-adopt their three children. A benefit for the Michigan Marriage Challenge, presented by the Jim Toy Community Center will be held on Sunday, February 23, 2014 at 1pm at The ARK, 316 S. Main, Ann Arbor, MI, 734-761-1800. Tickets: $250 Benefactor - reserved seating house floor front & center, $100 Supporters - reserved seating house center and $25 General Admission. All of the artists and the attorneys are donating their time to help raise critically needed funds. This benefit is an opportunity for supporters of marriage equality to help make it a reality. Emceed by U of M Professor Holly Hughes, the evening will feature artists such as singer songwriter Vienna Teng (viennateng.com/), folk duo Nervous But Excited in a greatly anticipated re-union (nervousbutexcited.com), the Dueling Divas Callie McKee and Robby Griswold of Arbor Opera Theatre, and many others. Help the DeBoer-Rowse Family: Hazel Park lesbian couple April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse are suing the state of Michigan for the right to legally wed and thereby co-adopt their three kids. Their case represents a direct, effective and rapid means of securing marriage equality in Michigan. The state licensed the two nurses as a couple to serve as foster parents of their three special needs children, but Michigan law allows only legally married couples to jointly adopt children. This civil right, afforded all others in Michigan, is not available to the DeBoer-Rowse family due to Michigan’s constitutional ban on the state recognizing marriages of same-gender couples. Because they are prohibited by law to adopt jointly, Rowse adopted their two sons, and DeBoer their daughter. The law firm Nessel and Kessel is arguing the DeBoer-Rowse family’s case pro bono; however, bringing in expert witnesses to demonstrate to the court that same-gender couples are fit parents is expensive. The lawyers estimate the witnesses and other legal expenses could cost a combined quarter of a million dollars at a minimum. Federal Judge Bernard A. Friedman, of the Eastern District of Michigan, will begin hearing evidence in DeBoer v. Snyder in late February.","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.

18808,EEB Thursday Seminar Series,"The formal discussion of how animals appear to be designed to function in their environment started over 200 years ago when William Paley described how animals were adapted to their environment by an omnipotent designer. The modern environment that wild animals face is changing dramatically due to human activities. Over 50 years ago, Richard Levins described adaptive phenotypic plasticity as an evolutionary strategy that animals could use to adapt to such changing environments. My research focuses on understanding the evolutionary strategies and physiological mechanisms by which real animals in real places adapt to changing environments. In this seminar, I provide an overview of my past, current, and future research in wild animals. I show that wild red squirrels live in an environment where natural selection on offspring phenotype fluctuates across years but that maternal stress responses to cues of density-mediated selection cause adaptive developmental plasticity in offspring phenotype that allows them to cope with this variable environment. Secondly, I show how the hormonal mediation of broad patterns of variation in mammalian life histories may mediate but also constrain adaptive life history plasticity to a changing environment. Third, I show how individual variation and plasticity in pro-social (cooperative) behavior in free-living meerkats may be caused by individual differences in stress physiology such that some individuals are constrained to exhibit either a high or low level of pro-social behavior regardless of changes in their social environment. Overall, these three examples of my research highlight how studying questions at the interface of ecology, evolution, and physiology can lead to new insights into the role of phenotypic plasticity in facilitating and constraining contemporary adaptation to altered environments.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1210,['2014-10-02 16:00'],['Ecology & biology'],F

15897,WCED Lecture,"Baktybek Beshimov, visiting professor, Northeastern University; visiting scholar, Center for International Studies, MIT This lecture will focus on the intriguing relationship of the weak states of Central Asia with great powers. Dr. Beshimov will describe what goals the local ruling elites pursue in their relationship with the U.S., Russia, and China; what tactics they use to manipulate the interests of these superpowers; and how this interplay of strategies and tactics impacts state building processes in the region. He will discuss how the concepts of “state weakness” and “strength” in the context of the complex geopolitical environment in the region take on unexpected forms and bear new meanings. Dr. Baktybek Beshimov is a visiting professor at Northeastern University and visiting scholar at the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He combines extensive experience in politics, education, diplomacy, and development. In politics, Dr. Beshimov was twice elected to the parliament of Kyrgyzstan, where he served as leader of the opposition fraction and parliament representative to the OSCE. In education, he served as provost/vice president for academic affairs of the American University in Central Asia and president of Osh State University. At both schools he promoted liberal arts education–an educational system very novel in that region to this day. In diplomacy, Dr. Beshimov served as Ambassador of Kyrgyzstan to India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh. In development, he played a key role in formulating development policy in Kyrgyzstan as national manager of the United Nations Ferghana Valley Development Program and of the UNDP LIFE program in the 1990s. In 2010 the National Endowment for Democracy awarded Dr. Beshimov the prestigious Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellowship. Also in 2010, he was a visiting scholar at Harvard University’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies. In 2011-2013, he was a visiting professor of government at Suffolk University. Dr. Beshimov is co-author of the books Ferghana Valley: The Heart of Central Asia, Civic Movements in Kyrgyzstan, and Interethnic Relations: Practice and Problems. He is a frequent contributor to international and regional media, and his articles have been published in the Wall Street Journal, Transitions Online, and other publications. Part of the series Pluralism in Politics and Culture, a new initiative jointly sponsored by CREES and WCED that examines the foundations of free and open societies. The project builds on the university’s rich legacy of study and support of the dissident culture in the former Soviet Union and on several existing efforts at U-M.

Archigram operated as an experimental think-tank. The practice produced a multitude of products that represented a shift in how architectural practice is considered including a magazine, projects, models, exhibitions and proposals. This shift in architectural practice focused on prioritizing processes and responsive structures for living. Influenced by popular culture and responding to the proliferation of technological advances at the time, as well as recognizing the increasing social and political discontent, Archigram’s production emphasized mobility and flexibility in ways that continue to have currency today. At Archigram, Crompton was an enthusiast of gadgets, machines, techniques and systems, and invented the provocative “things that go bang in the night” projects. He orchestrated the Archigram Archives in 1975 when the practice ended. With Ron Herron, Crompton was responsible for the assembly and design of the major exhibition “Archigram: Experimental Architecture 1961-74,” which opened in Vienna in 1994. He shepherded the Archigram Exhibition around Europe, Asia and North America. Archigram was awarded the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture by the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2002. Outside of Archigram, Crompton had a strong involvement with the Architectural Association School since 1965 where he taught for over thirty years. More recently, he taught masters courses in Architecture and Urban Design at The Bartlett School of Architecture and frequently lectures in the U.S. and Europe. Exhibition opening reception for Crompton's exhibition, ""Archigram,"" will immediately follow at the Liberty Research Annex (305 W.

21387,Depression on College Campuses Conference,"Recent research indicates that more than half of college students report “above average” or “tremendous” stress levels, and 30 percent say that stress has a negative impact on their academic performance. While there will always be some level of stress, competition, and pressure in a college student’s life, must success always be equated with stress? And ultimately, is it possible for a university to promote a culture of academic rigor and excellence, while simultaneously encouraging positive student mental health? Join us for the 13th Annual Depression on College Campuses Conference to explore these questions, and learn about new research findings and model programs which demonstrate how a focus on managing the climate of stress on campus – and helping students to cope more effectively with the inevitable bouts of stress that will occur – can improve overall student wellness and allow students to achieve their full potential. The conference will feature a choice of intensive three-hour workshops in addition to keynote presentations, panel discussions, and concurrent sessions. Online registration is now open. Applications have been made to provide Continuing Education credits for social workers and certified counselors. Please check back in early January for confirmation of the number of credit that will be provided. Registration is FREE for all students from any campus. Registration fee for non-students is $135 before February 6th, and $150 after February 6th.

27042,Developmental Area Brown Bag - Speech segmentation in typically developing children and children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: an MEG study/Trajectories of Smoking Over the Transition to Retirement,".ABSTRACT: Speech segmentation, or identifying syllables and words in a continuous linguistic stream, is foundational for language acquisition. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the neural mechanisms that support children’s ability to identify syllabic units in a continuous linguistic stream and how these mechanisms might be affected by neurodevelopmental impairments in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Although ASD is characterized by delays in language acquisition, it is generally unknown what learning mechanisms lead to impaired language in ASD. Typically developing children are able to utilize regularities in speech (e.g. transitional probabilities, TP) in order to detect various aspects of phonotactics and syntactic rules. However, it is not established whether children with ASD can also take advantage of statistical regularities in naturally spoken language. The present study investigated the neuro-cognitive mechanism of speech segmentation by comparing typically developing children to children with ASD using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) neuroimaging during a language-based statistical learning paradigm. We investigated learning ability and concurrent brain activation while 15 ASD children and 14 healthy controls (ages 8-12) listened to three repetitions of a 2-minute passage in a new language (Italian). Italian passages included target words with high (TP = 1.0; HTP) and low (TP = 0.33; LTP) internal predictability between syllables. Behavioral testing at the end of the session revealed that typically developing children outperformed children with ASD on both the HTP (t(24) = 3.00, p < 0.01) and LTP (t(26) = 4.39, p < 0.001) target words. MEG measures of event related brain responses indicate learning differences between the groups in the left primary auditory cortex, left superior temporal gyrus, and the left inferior frontal gyrus. Interestingly, learning performance across the groups appeared to be a better predictor of brain response to target words than did the developmental profile of the children. Our findings contribute new insights to better understanding the developing brain and provide implications for language and communication impairments observed in ASD. BIO: Neelima is a third year PhD candidate in the Developmental program. She graduated from Michigan State University in 2013 with a B.S. in Psychology and a specialization in Cognitive Science. In general, her area of research examines the underlying brain mechanisms that support language acquisition in infants and children, and the various trajectories of language development over the course of the human lifespan (e.g. bilingualism, language impairments). Her focus is on the use of multimodal neuroimaging techniques and methodologies applied to developmental populations. Today, she will be presenting on her 619 project. ABSTRACT: Retirement is an important life transition that may motivate older adults to make significant changes to their health behaviors, such as quitting smoking. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study of US adults over age 50, to examine the different trajectories of smoking over the transition to retirement. We then determine the role of a recent hospitalization in differentiating between individuals who continue to smoke from those who quit during the retirement transition. Using a group-based trajectory approach, we identified five distinct trajectories of smoking over the transition to retirement. Our results suggest that hospitalizations that occur close to retirement may be interpreted differently from those that occur during the working years and may be more likely to promote health behavior change. In conclusion, there is no single trajectory that characterizes the influence of retirement on smoking behavior. Healthcare professionals should consider increasing the salience of upcoming life transitions like retirement when counseling older adults on smoking cessation. BIO: Jennifer Sun is a joint MD/PhD student at the University of Michigan who is currently pursuing her PhD in Developmental Psychology. Her advisors are Dr. Jacqui Smith and Dr. Toni Antonucci, and her research interests revolve around how psychosocial factors affect chronic disease outcomes and healthcare utilization among older adults. She hopes to pursue a career in primary care and incorporate more behavioral interventions into clinical practice. Today, she will be presenting some recent work on trajectories of smoking over the transition to retirement.",Map East Hall - 4464 East Hall,['2016-02-15 12:00'],['Brown bag'],F

In this daylong mix of presentations, panels, and conversations, we’ll discuss how to disentangle luck from skill. We’ll explore whether today’s successful individuals and organizations are truly great or have they serendipitously lit upon strategies or actions that provide temporary advantages. We’ll also consider the extent to which the contributions of skill and luck vary across domains. Are, for example, golfers more dependent on luck than tennis players? Are investment bankers more dependent on skill than venture capitalists? We’ll also touch on streaks. Fifty-six games in a row cannot be luck. Or can it? And, finally, we’ll try to unpack the effects of the increasing complexity and rates of change in the economic, political, social, and even biological worlds on the returns to skill.

His initial work addressed aspects of plate tectonics. Following a 2-year post-doc at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and 4 months as an exchange scientist in the USSR studying earthquake prediction, he began an assistant professorship at MIT, where he turned his attention to the processes by which continents deform on a large scale and in particular how mountain ranges form. After 12 years of being dissatisfied with his teaching, he quit and returned to the life of a post-doc. In 2000, eager to change the direction of his research to include the study of how large-scale geodynamic processes have affected climate on geologic time scales, he moved to the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Colorado and became a fellow in the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES). Peter Molnar’s research focuses largely on these two questions: (1) how large-scale geodynamics cause deformation of the Earth’s crust, including earthquakes and the building of mountain ranges, and (2) how shifting continents, emergence of islands, growth of mountains, etc. affect climate on geologic time scales. His work has included fieldwork in remote parts of the world, and numerical calculations of processes that obey rules of fluid mechanics, but he is incompetent, and unwelcome, in a laboratory. He teaches a graduate seminar in “Tectonics and Climate,” among other courses.",Map School of Social Work Building - 1636,['2016-03-11 16:00'],['Lecture'],F

16907,"Todd Cronan Lecture, ""The Medium Has No Message: The (Non)Politics of Medium from Kandinsky to Benjamin""","Does the medium have a message? Is there a deep connection between media and subjectivity? Does the ubiquity of images that seemingly defines modernity constitute or transform our consciousness? Do the media that we use shape or even determine our politics? For a wide range of modernists and (for most) postmodernists the connection is assumed, a given. Looking at a foundational moment of media theory–the moment of Kandinsky’s first abstractions to Benjamin’s theory of mechanical reproduction–I show how a growing pessimism about human agency finds its resolution in a utopian optimism about technology’s effects (even or especially when that technology is the object of critique). I will show what is mistaken about correlating media and subjectivity. I will also suggest how this now canonized mistake can and should be replaced with something better. Todd Cronan is Assistant Professor of art history at Emory University, where his research centers on twentieth-century art and art theory with particular emphasis on problems around expression, intention, affect, form and meaning. He is the author of Against Affective Formalism: Matisse, Bergson, Modernism (Univ. of Minnesota Press, 2013) and Matisse (Phaidon, 2014). His articles have appeared in the New German Critique, British Journal of the History of Philosophy, Design and Culture, Zetischrift fur Kunstgeschichte, qui parle and nonsite.org and he serves on the editorial board of nonsite.org. His current book project, Seeing Photographically, looks at photographic debates about the ontology of the medium and how those ideas shaped both photographic and painterly practice in the first half of the 20th c.",Map Tappan Hall - 180,['2014-03-21 16:00'],['Visual arts'],F
28565,Transduction and Medial Conversion: Line—Letter—Trace,"In the spring of 2008, the First Sounds Initiative made international headlines by releasing digitally recovered audio from a recording dated April 9, 1860, seventeen years before Thomas Edison invented his phonograph. The haunting vocal rendition of “Au Clair de la Lune” had been recorded by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville on the phonautograph, an instrument he had designed to trace airborne sound vibrations onto soot-blackened sheets of paper using an artificial eardrum. His goal in transducing sounds was to convert them into graphical texts people would access just as they did other “writings”: namely, by exposing them to light and looking at them. By playing back Scott’s phonautograms as sound, we arguably subverted his original intentions, but at the same time we made it possible for listeners to experience his work in a newly enlightening and enchanting way. Drawing on this and other recent cases of media being “played” against the grain, I’ll explore how novel approaches to the history and practice of transduction can challenge received wisdom about what counts as historical audio and video. Patrick Feaster is a specialist in the history, culture, and preservation of early time-based media. A three-time Grammy nominee, co-founder of the First Sounds Initiative, and current President of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections, he has been actively involved in locating, identifying, and contextualizing many of the world's oldest sound recordings and has pioneered a number of digital processing strategies for bringing historical sources to life as audio, video, and 3D imagery. He is the author of Pictures of Sound: One Thousand Years of Educed Audio, 980-1980, as well as various album notes and articles about the history and theory of phonography. He received his doctorate in Folklore and Ethnomusicology in 2007 from Indiana University Bloomington, where he is now Media Preservation Specialist for the Media Digitization and Preservation Initiative.","Map 202 S.

Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, Betty Ford Classroom (1110), Weill Hall 735 S. State Street, Ann Arbor 48109-3091 Sponsored by: Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy (CLOSUP) Co-Sponsors: Energy Institute; LSA Political Science; Climate Center; University of Michigan Program in the Environment (PitE) Description: How do Americans think about energy? Is the debate over fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable energy highly partisan and ideological? Are people’s preferences for different energy sources idiosyncratic, or is there a common pattern that explains how people view energy across sources? How much does concern about climate change weigh on these opinions? David Konisky answers these questions and more in a discussion of his 2014 book, Cheap and Clean. About the speaker: David Konisky is Associate Professor of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. Konisky’s research focuses on American politics and public policy, with particular emphasis on regulation, environmental politics and policy, state politics, and public opinion. His research has been published in leading political science and public policy journals, and he has the authored or edited three books, including most recently, Failed Promises: Evaluating the Federal Government's Response to Environmental Justice (MIT Press, 2015). Konisky earned his Ph.D. in political science at MIT, and has master’s degrees in environmental management and international relations from Yale University and a bachelor’s degree in history and environmental studies from Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to joining the faculty at Indiana University, he served on the faculty at Georgetown University.

Why do tax-paying, prison-funding citizens rarely get the chance to see such images? And what roles do these pictures play for those within the system? With stark aesthetic detail and meticulous documentation, Prison Obscura builds the case that Americans must come face to face with these images and imaging technologies both to grasp the cancerous proliferation of the U.S. prison system and to connect with those it confines.

33500,"Social, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics (SBEE)","Abstract: We study markets for sensitive personal information. An agent wants to communicate with another party but any revealed information can be intercepted and sold to a third party whose reaction harms the agent. The market for information induces an adverse sorting effect, allocating the information to those types of third parties who harm the agent most. In equilibrium, this limits information transmission by the agent, but never fully deters it. We also consider agents who naively provide information to the market. Their presence renders traded information more valuable and, thus, harms sophisticated agents by increasing the third party’s demand for information. Half-baked regulatory interventions may hurt naive agents without helping sophisticated agents. Comparing monopoly and oligopoly markets, we find that oligopoly is often better for the agent: it requires a higher value of traded information and therefore has to grant the agent more privacy.",Map North Quad - 3100 (Ehrlicher Room),['2016-09-12 15:30'],"['Economics', 'Seminar']",F

Steve himself has recorded for Mercury and for his own 98 Pounder label, the name referring to his high-school wrestling weight. Over the course of his life he’s met Elvis Presley (who hugged his sister for far too long), trick-or-treated at Liberace’s house (each finger had a diamond ring), was Bob Hope’s favorite altar boy (according to him), and bravely traveled the world busking before he knew how to do it, His eclectic songbag is an unpredictable mixture of comic and serious, sometimes within the same song, and his stage show is a wonderfully unpredictable freeform mix of elements. X frontman John Doe once said, ""My idea of hell would be having Steve Poltz open for me every day. There's no place left for the audience to go.""","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.

At the very least, sustainability does not seem to be on their checklist of mandatory considerations before making most decisions. Everything from policy to the execution of initiatives often misses the mark on the dire need to transition our society to one that is in alignment with nature, rather than at odds with it. What, if any, national government strategy exists to encourage social progress that meets the needs of everyone, effective protection of the environment, and prudent use of natural resources, while maintaining high and stable levels of economic growth and employment? Added to these ongoing issues is the unrest in the Middle East and its impact on the price of energy. These are questions to be explored with a panel of U-M faculty, alumni experts and government insiders.","Off Campus Location - School for International Service, American University, 4400 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016",['2011-04-07 18:30'],['Environmental'],F

12863,Civic Engagement and Performance Management,"Abstract “The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do, for themselves in their separate and individual capacities.” - Abraham Lincoln Government exists to produce positive outcomes in the community and those outcomes are “co-produced” by government and citizens working together. Every citizen has political responsibilities since improvements in government performance only occur as the result of a series of political acts. In the 21st Century, performance management means partnering with citizens to produce results. Nothing else works. We’ll address some of the aspects of this co-production and how it is working across America, including community economic development, place making and the tools and techniques of deliberative democracy. Dr. Mark Funkhouser is the Director of the Governing Institute. Prior to that, he was mayor of Kansas City, Missouri from 2007 to 2011. Funkhouser was the first government professional ever elected by Kansas Citizens to serve as their mayor. During his controversial term he relied heavily on his experience and training in public finance to lead the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. When he left office, the city’s finances were in the best shape they had been in over a decade, a feat accomplished in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression. Funkhouser began his career as a guard at George Junior Republic, a youth corrections facility in Grove City, Pennsylvania. He went on to work as a rehabilitation counselor with the Pennsylvania State Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation and then as an assistant professor at Salem College in Salem, West Virginia, teaching social work and sociology. In 1978 he began a career as a performance auditor, first in Tennessee state government and then for the City of Kansas City, where he served as City Auditor from 1988 until 2006. Under his leadership, the City Auditor’s Office won the Knighton Award for outstanding auditing in 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2004. GOVERNING recognized Funkhouser as one of its Public Officials of the Year in 2003. While he was the City Auditor, Funkhouser also taught courses in public budgeting, program evaluation, policy analysis, public finance and related topics in the MPA programs of the University of Kansas and the University of Missouri at Kansas City. He has written extensively about government performance and accountability and spoken at numerous seminars and workshops throughout the world. His book, Honest, Competent Government, was the first global study of performance auditing. In addition, he has served on the editorial boards of several publications including the American Review of Public Administration and the Journal of Government Financial Management. Funkhouser’s academic training includes a bachelor’s degree in political science from Thiel College, a master’s degree in social work from West Virginia University, an MBA in accounting and finance from Tennessee State University, and an interdisciplinary PhD in public administration and sociology from the University of Missouri at Kansas City.

35464,Screening/Q&A: Composed,"Through the lens of professional classical musicians, Composed explores the many ways we experience and can address performance anxiety. Faced with the judgment of peers, audience, conductors, and worst of all themselves, these musicians spend years trying to understand and overcome the physical and mental manifestations of their anxiety. Through their stories, we learn valuable lessons learned over a lifetime of professional performance; and we find that we are not alone in our quest to overcome the fear of failure and embarrassment. For anyone wanting to feel strength over fear and compassion over judgment, or simply seeking a closer look at anxiety and what makes us tick, Composed opens the door to a world of high stakes, high pressure, and peak performing. Following the screening a Q&A will be held with the film’s director John Beder, Julie Nagel (psychoanalyst, psychologist, pianist, and author of ""Melodies of the Mind""), Louis Nagel (pianist and Emeritus Professor of Piano and Piano Literature), and Emily Hyssong (CAPS Counsellor).",Map Earl V.

29781,John Dinkeloo Memorial Lecture: David Adjaye,"The University of Michigan's Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning presents...the John Dinkeloo Memorial Lecture by David Adjaye. David Adjaye OBE is recognized as a leading architect of his generation. Adjaye was born in Tanzania to Ghanaian parents and his influences range from contemporary art, music and science to African art forms and the civic life of cities. In 1994 he set up his first office, where his ingenious use of materials and his sculptural ability established him as an architect with an artist’s sensibility and vision. He reformed his studio as Adjaye Associates in 2000 and immediately won several prestigious commissions. In Oslo he designed the Nobel Peace Centre in the shell of a disused railway station (completed in 2005). In London his design for the Whitechapel Idea Store pioneered a new approach to the provision of information services (2005). Later projects in London included the Stephen Lawrence Centre, with teaching and community spaces (2007), Rivington Place, an exhibition venue and resource centre (2007), and the Bernie Grant Centre for the performing arts (2007). Adjaye Associates’ largest completed project to date is the £160 million Moscow School of Management Skolkovo (2010). Adjaye Associates now has four international offices, with projects throughout the world. These include a shopping and cultural complex in Beirut (ongoing), a concept store in Lagos (2014), a new headquarters building for the International Finance Corporation in Dakar (ongoing) and a hospital in Rwanda (ongoing). Adjaye frequently collaborates with contemporary artists on art and installation projects. Examples include The Upper Room, with thirteen paintings by Chris Ofili (2002), Within Reach, a second installation with Ofili in the British pavilion at the Venice Biennale (2003), and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Art for the 21st Century Pavilion that was designed to show a projection work by Olafur Eliasson, Your Black Horizon, at the 2005 Venice Biennale. The Upper Room is now in the permanent collection of Tate Britain. Adjaye is now collaborating with Okwui Enwezor on the design of the forthcoming 56th Venice Art Biennale. Adjaye has taught at the Royal College of Art, where he had previously studied, and at the Architectural Association School in London, and has held distinguished professorships at the universities of Pennsylvania, Yale and Princeton. He is currently the John C. Portman Design Critic in Architecture at Harvard. He was awarded the OBE for services to architecture in 2007, received the Design Miami/ Year of the Artist title in 2011, the Wall Street Journal Innovator Award in 2013 and the W.E.B. Du Bois medal from Harvard University. The material from Adjaye’s ten-year study of the capital cities of Africa was shown in Urban Africa, an exhibition at the Design Museum, London (2010) and published as African Metropolitan Architecture (New York, 2011, and as Adjaye Africa Architecture, London, 2011). He was the artistic director of GEO-graphics: A map of art practices in Africa, past and present, a major exhibition at the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels (2010). The last exhibition of his architectural work, David Adjaye: Output, was held at Gallery MA, Tokyo (2010) and he is now collaborating with Haus der Kunst in Munich and the Art Institute of Chicago on a comprehensive retrospective exhibition, which will open in 2015. The John Dinkeloo Memorial Lecture was established to recognize John Dinkeloo's extraordinary contributions to architecture, to honor his distinguished professional work and to pay tribute to this highly respected alumnus of the Architecture Program at the University of Michigan. About University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning: The Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of Michigan is a leader in interdisciplinary education and research with a focus on creating a more beautiful, inclusive and better built environment.

Ever since they started singing together on the street corners, farmers' markets, and subway stations of New York City, strangers and neighbors come to rejoice in the sound, and there is no divide between performer and spectator. Paste describes their sound this way: ""Dusty acoustic guitars, wailing fiddles and weeping accordions, with a woozy-yet-skintight rhythm section-- and topped off with burr-edged vocals that sound like they've been soaked in a Mason jar for generations–it's the type of music that blurs the line between past and present so thoroughly, and so deftly, that time feels irrelevant."" Hurray for the Riff Raff is Alynda lee Segarra, a 25 year old Puerto Rican from the Bronx. After leaving home at an early age to travel the country, she eventually settled in New Orleans where she began to perform and record with a revolving cast of musicians. Alynda and her longtime gunslinger on fiddle, Yosi Perlstein, met up with a young honky-tonk band called the Tumbleweeds, just as Alynda began to expand her musical palette to include country, rock 'n' roll, pop, and soul. In the tradition of Bob Dylan with Band and Neil Young with Crazy Horse, Alynda and Yosi recruited the Tumbleweeds to be their touring band, drastically altering the sound of Hurray for the Riff Raff. From the swamp pop of “Little Black Star” to the classic country of “Look Out Mama,” to the psychedelia of “Ode to John and Yoko” and even the surf rock of “Lake of Fire,"" Hurray for the Riff Raff covers a wide array of musical ground, with every song unified by Alynda’s soulful vocals and expert songwriting.

Among others, we cloned the ameiotic 1 gene in maize, which is responsible for the switch from mitotic cell division to meiosis in maize, and found that the mechanism of meiosis initiation differs not only between fungi, mammals, and plants but also between monocot and dicot plants. We also studied sequence variation in several meiotic recombination genes in maize and its wild ancestor teosinte and discovered that a large fraction of these genes were targets of positive selection during maize domestication and subsequent breeding. These results suggest that even though meiosis is an ancient and conserved process some meiotic genes show rapid evolution.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1210,['2010-09-16 16:00'],[],F

38470,"HEP-Astro Seminar | Probing QCD Matter at Extremely High Temperatures in ATLAS: Jet Measurements in p+p, p+Pb and Pb+Pb Collisions at 5 TeV",Collisions between two lead nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider produce extremely high temperature QCD matter which is best described as consisting of deconfined quarks and gluons. A powerful tool to understand this matter is to use the high momentum quarks and gluons generated in hard scattering processes in the earliest stages of the nuclear collision as probes of the matter at later times. These measurements use modifications to the jet rates and properties induced by the scattering of the probes off the constituents of the matter to infer the nature of the interactions and constrain the properties of the matter. This talk will describe the new measurements at 5 TeV collision energy of jets and their properties in the ATLAS detector in lead-lead collisions as well proton-proton and proton-lead collisions which provide a baseline for the lead-lead measurements.,Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-06 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']",F

We use the stochastic Perron's method and characterize the finite dimensional approximation as a viscosity solution to the corresponding HJB equation. It turns out that this solution is the concave envelope of the cost function with respect to the atoms of the terminal law.

He played the cello and switched to the guitar, then to the blues, after a DJ uncle introduced him to the likes of T-Bone Walker and Snooks Eaglin. The All Music Guide's J. Poet wrote that Seth ""uses the blues as a backbone for tunes that will equally please roots, Americana, folk, pop, and blues fans. He's a fine guitarist, but his playing never calls attention to itself; it's always placed in service of the song and the lyrics crackle with insight and subtle wit.""

In May 2015, Sally Bjork, photographer at the U-M Department of the History of Art’s Visual Resources Collections, took part in a 16-day tour through major cities and regions of Iran. Her charge was to photograph sites, monuments, artwork, and urban and rural environments that could be used for research and teaching amongst numerous disciplines. The result - some 8,000 images that celebrate life, vibrancy, and color, as well as Iranian traditions of art and design through the centuries. Bjork selected various images from this extensive collection to create “This, too, is Iran,” broadening the perspective of Iran for an American audience. Organized by the Detroit Center, this exhibition is made possible by the Center for Middle Eastern and North African Studies, Department of Anthropology, Department of Comparative Literature, Department of the History of Art (Freer Fund), and Department of Near Eastern Studies.

4068,Edge compartmental infectious disease models,"The structure of social interactions along which disease spreads can be represented using a network. When we investigate disease spreading in a network we find that many of the assumptions of mass action mixing fail. Individuals with many contacts tend to become infected earlier, and in turn infect more individuals, leading to faster initial growth. However, the remaining population has fewer contacts than average, and so the growth rate decreases more rapidly and the epidemic eventually dies out sooner than mass action predicts. Unfortunately mathematical models of infectious disease tend to require (arbitrarily) many differential equations. Recent work by Erik Volz (SIR dynamics in random networks with heterogeneous connectivity, JMB 2008) showed that it is possible to capture the dynamics exactly with a low-dimensional system. My own work (A note on a paper by Erik Volz: SIR dynamics in random networks, JMB 2010) has shown that it is possible to simplify this derivation and in so doing arrive at an even simpler system. Our more recent unpublished work simplifies the derivation further, and allows easy generalization to a wide range of (SI or SIR) diseases and population structures, including populations whose contacts change in time. The key simplification comes from focusing our attention to the fraction of edges that connect to susceptible, infected, or recovered individuals rather than the fraction of the population with given infection status. I will show how to derive these systems and compare the resulting predictions with simulation.",Map West Hall - 335,['2010-10-25 14:30'],[],F

A designer and architect, Gary cultivates a thorough research as an integral part of the design process and the office quickly made it’s mark with projects such as Prostneset Ferry Terminal in Tromsø, Vestbane National Library, Filipstad Masterplan, and the conceptual work for The Meeting Room of the Future. This research culminated in 2008 with the curation of the Oslo Architecture Trienalle under the title The Culture of Risk. Gary Bates studied at Virginia Polytechnic University & State University (1985 - 1990). Bates began his collaboration with Rem Koolhaas in 1992 at OMA where he became a director, and from 1995-1998, a principal in charge of the Asian desk.

18601,Sponsor Blood Drive,"To make an appointment to donate, please visit redcrossblood.org, sponsor code ""goblue"". BDU seeks to improve the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s blood donation eligibility criteria. Currently, men who have sex with men are banned for life from donating blood. We firmly believe this is a discriminatory and inadequate policy. With a holistic change to eligibility criteria, greater attention can be given to a greater number of risk factors and the safety of the blood supply could be improved. If these changes were implemented, it would also eliminate the existing social injustice against men who have sex with men.One way in which we are raising awareness of this policy is through sponsor drives, which are blood drives in which an ineligible donor brings someone who is eligible to donate on their behalf. When every presenting donor is accompanied by an ineligible individual, the potential to collect twice as many pints of blood is visually demonstrated. Rather than interfering with ongoing blood drives, this format is constructive and has the ultimate goal of saving as many lives as possible. With the support of many organizations and blood collection agencies throughout the United States, we hope to approach the FDA with our rationale for changing the health history questionnaire.",Michigan League,['2014-09-12 12:00'],[],F

These direct impacts of human activities on forests interact with other anthropogenic drivers such as climate variability to affect the capacity of forests to provide ecosystem services.

The project will feature a video installation in the IH gallery, an interactive portrait exhibition in GalleryDAAS, and a video screening of the award winning film, Chameleon Street. The screenings will be held at the Institute of the Humanities and at the Charles Wright Museum in Detroit, MI. About the project: The Crown: Shani Peters and Contemporary Construction of Self in America is a series of projects by artist Shani Peters that will examine the socially acceptable yet complicated concept of Black pride and success. Crowns, symbolic of kings and queens, and conferred on any number of Black popular culture figures from James Brown to Biggie, are also symbols for systems of inequitably distributed resources and injustice. This multi-part project—which includes two exhibitions, a film screening, and a panel discussion—asks the question: what does it mean to acknowledge the need for these forms of pride and success while recognizing their problems? It further complicates the question with a consideration of the similar celebration and pride that comes from attaining degrees of higher education which offer obvious opportunities, yet can alienate students of African descent from their origins. The artist asks, how do Black people register these complicated elements in ways that allow them to move progressively through western power structures towards futures that reflect their right to dignity and self-determination?

31189,Mira Henry: The View Inside,"Before joining the faculty of the Southern California Institute of Architecture in Los Angeles, Mira Henry spent several years as a project architect, immersed in the everyday, banal details of how buildings get built: construction drawings, material specs, and building codes. She became an expert in seeing the world the way an architect sees it. But as a progressive architectural thinker, Henry’s inspiration has been to deconstruct that vision, to “unsee” the very forms and representations that constitute an architect’s basic language. Through speculative experiments and conceptual drawings Henry discovers in static architectural details an unsettling range of figurative expression, including, for example, the way the profiles of roof eaves resemble human heads. Wallpaper, with its ability to mask, transform, or animate a space, is also a prominent element in her work. Her projects explore how these features animate our subjective experience—what she calls our “shifting fantasies”—of architectural space.

29358,Altan,"Altan, named for Loch Altan in Ireland's County Donegal, has arguably had a wider impact on audiences over the quarter century than any other traditional Irish band. Their dynamic and warm live performances mix the most touching old Irish songs with hard-hitting reels and jigs, and the band members' interest in and sheer enjoyment of each other musically is apparent even to audience members new to the Irish tradition. For the Irish music enthusiast, Altan has a treasure trove of brilliant moves to offer: the mix of sounds from Donegal with outside influences, the sheer virtuosity of the players, the beauty, delicate singing, and down-to-earth charm of singer and fiddler Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh. Anywhere they go, a concert by Altan is the Irish music event of the year. Popmatters calls the band's latest album, ""The Widening Gyre,"" ""a defining moment for Altan.""","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.

Synopsis: GO FAR: THE CHRISTOPHER RUSH STORY chronicles the inspirational life of Christopher Rush, a quadriplegic and national MDA poster child, who lived with muscular dystrophy from birth to his death at age 30, well beyond his predicted two years of life. Chris achieved extraordinary goals despite impossible odds and left behind a philosophy of life for all of us to follow. GO FAR is a motivational film that will inspire not only persons with disabilities, but everyone, to follow their dreams and achieve them, no matter the obstacles. Featuring Tony Orlando, Jerry Lewis, and narrated by Mark Hamill.   Shortly before his death Chris invented a program called GO FAR, a motivational program that he intended to promote by traveling the world and inspiring those in need. This film's purpose is to be used as a tool to promote Chris’ message and continue his goal of promoting the GO FAR philosophy. Chris’ memoirs state “I think it’s true that we all serve a purpose in life and I’ve always accepted my own as being one of a messenger. It became my mission to teach others--that no matter the obstacles in front of them--they too can GO FAR.” This presentation is part of the U-M Services for Students with Disabilities 40th Anniversary.",Map Alumni Center,['2014-09-09 18:00'],"['Community service', 'Film', 'Health & wellness', 'Medicine', 'Ssd 40th anniversary']",F

And on top of that, he's a tall tale teller of the first order, with a dry sense of humor that would be reason enough in itself to come to one of his concerts. Says Newsday: ""Unlike Richard Thompson or Robert Fripp, in whose league he belongs, Legg seems never to have been seduced by rock. But unlike Leo Kottke or Ry Cooder, whom he also occasionally resembles, Legg is an adventurer, not an archivist.""

13666,American Mars,"Since its inception in the late 1990s, American Mars has been a musical anomaly in their hometown of Detroit. In a town often passed over by touring Americana acts and dominated by garage and punk, the band has persevered for over a decade with its unique brand of atmospheric, often confessional, roots-influenced rock. The band features singer, songwriter, and guitarist Thomas Trimble, multi-instrumentalist David Feeny, bassist Garth Girard, and drummer Alex Trajano. Multi-instrumentalist and producer Feeny has worked with Blanche, Loretta Lynn, and The White Stripes, and the band toured with the Avett Brothers, Chuck Prophet, Langhorne Slim, and The Rumble Strips. Last year American Mars released its fourth full-length album, ""Chasing Vapors."" Michigan's iSpy magazine praised American Mars as ""bracing, entrancing, and warming in their Western-wrung rock churn.""","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.
