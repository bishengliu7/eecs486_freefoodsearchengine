As it will demonstrate, the seeds of an independent new musical culture were already planted in the 1860s, after the foundation of the musical equivalent of the Salon des Réfusées – the Théatre Lyrique. From here it will examine those composers who emerged in this period, such as Gounod, Bizet, Saint-Saens and Chabrier, the latter becoming one of the first great collectors of impressionist painting. Finally, it will consider how Debussy was able to profit not only from academic institutions such as the Conservatoire, but from France's now thriving independent culture, which included the Symbolists and the Société Nationale de Musique FranÃ§aise.",Map Museum of Art - Auditorium,['2009-10-30 15:00']

Locally, this is reflected in Kugak fusion, a genre that mixes Western harmonies and melodies with Korean soundworlds, and presented in spectacles that update traditional genres, incorporating technological wizadry, exuberant and outgoing performance, and flashy staging, in ways that are designed to appeal to new audiences. Powerful lobbies of performers and scholars within Korea who value traditional music, kugak, see in it a depth of identity that provides distinction, and reject Kugak fusion as a poor amalgam of East and West. Nor has the promotion of new genres been well received by foreign critics, revealing a distance between what is popular in Korea and what is popular abroad.

Their song ""Heaven's My Home,"" was nominated for a Grammy in its recording by the Duhks and was featured in the film ""The Secret Life of Bees."" Sam & Ruby gently blend R&B, folk, and pop into a sound that's immediately warm and welcoming, but, Ruby says, ""We try not to fear honesty in our writing and tackle the things that hurt, the things that aren't always pretty. Sam & Ruby were recently named Discovery Artist of the Year by Sirius-XM radio's Coffee House channel. They're joined on tonight's show by Sweden's Abalone Dots, who mix bluegrass, country music, Swedish folk sounds, and harmony singing. Recording for the major label Sony/BMG, they performed at Nashville's legendary 12th & Porter club and basically blew away the crowd of assembled country music industry heavyweights.

But their relationship is far from traditional–Linda was brought up Catholic in Arizona and met Ali at college in the 1980's. Shot over two years during the American invasion of Iraq, this poignant doc shows how Linda and Ali struggle to surmount their cultural differences while raising their seven children in a lively, loving home. Unlike many foreign wives, Linda adopted the Shiite Muslim traditions of her husband, and swathed in black, she looks like any other Qatari woman. Within the four walls of their comfortable home, however, Western and Middle Eastern ideals, ethics and attitudes often collide. The filmmaker hones in on surprising and candid family discussions about issues such as second wives, religion and Qatari society, painting a fascinating portrait of a family living at the complex intersection of gender roles, nationality and religion. This entertaining film is a unique opportunity to view Muslim culture through Linda's eyes, counteracting the often distorted images provided by the mainstream media.",Map School of Social Work Building - Room 1636,['2010-02-08 12:00']

127,EEB Thursday Seminar Series: Ecological and evolutionary responses of small mammals to late Quaternary climatic change,"Abstract: Environmental change has always impacted the Earth's biota. Extracting the responses of populations, species and communities to perturbations of the past is one of the best ways of unraveling how they will respond to perturbations of the future. Historic data from large environmental events such as the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) provide a unique opportunity for insights into resilience of mammals in communities. The transition from the cold, arid Late Pleistocene (LP) glacial period to the warm, mesic Holocene interglacial witnessed extinction of many mammals in North America: 70 of ~220 of the largest species (32%) disappeared due to climatic and human stressors. The smaller mammalian survivors of the extinction (e.g., voles, gophers, ground squirrels, etc.) persisted but showed range changes, species turnover, diversity decline and significant alteration of population structure. I propose that study of historic responses to past climatic change fosters a richer understanding of the future. I demonstrate how populations and species interacted with their prehistoric environments to persist: by reshuffling individuals, increasing or decreasing population size, and favoring particular genotypes, all of which leave a mark on communities. Empirical evidence of this dynamic remains difficult to obtain, but a phylochronologic approach makes it possible.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1200,['2010-03-11 16:00']
128,Ivan Karp: Museums and Their Communities or Communities and Their Museums,"In 1992 I published two essays as part of the edited volume, Museums and Communities: The Politics of Public Culture. At that time it seemed sufficient to characterize the relationships among museums and communities as varied and complex, mediated by the two elements of the civil societies of which they are a part and the complex and often contradictory social identities that museum professionals and members of the museum audience bring to the museum encounter. Since then both the world we live in and our sense of how it works has changed underneath us. While we know that museums have always been global institutions, increasingly salient and contradictory processes of globalization and the development of global cultural institutions have become more and more significant aspects of the environment in which museums operate and live or die. In addition the spread of technology in such fora as data collection, collecting and storage, and exhibition are more and more part of the ways in which museums and communities relate. This paper rethinks the politics of institution, society and identity as they have been affected by changing social and cultural processes over the last fifteen to twenty years, using as case studies the papers presented at this colloquium. The cases here include colonial museums, changing community museums and studies of how different local communities have made use of museums. The paper examines how these examples can illuminate processes of governmentality, changing identity claims and possible new roles for museums in society.",Map Museum of Art - Helmut Stern Auditorium,['2010-03-30 19:30']

By focusing on UBC MOA the paper will describe the expectations of the new research infrastructure and the Museum's new role as a catalyst to bring about new alignments between different disciplines and faculties. It will explore the potential of experimental and more orthodox exhibitions in giving uniqueness to undergraduate teaching and the use of its collections in furnishing discrete research projects as part of the UBC undergraduate experience. Above all it will describe and explore ways in which the museum movement's newly found penchant for challenging, critical, multi-disciplinary, controversial and sometimes even discomforting exhibitions and programs can contribute to revitalizing both educational and the wider public culture and provide vibrant and important linkages between universities and communities.",Map Museum of Art - Helmut Stern Auditorium,['2010-03-10 19:30']

As it will demonstrate, the seeds of an independent new musical culture were already planted in the 1860s, after the foundation of the musical equivalent of the Salon des Réfusées – the Théatre Lyrique. From here it will examine those composers who emerged in this period, such as Gounod, Bizet, Saint-Saens and Chabrier, the latter becoming one of the first great collectors of impressionist painting. Finally, it will consider how Debussy was able to profit not only from academic institutions such as the Conservatoire, but from France's now thriving independent culture, which included the Symbolists and the Société Nationale de Musique FranÃ§aise.",Map Museum of Art - Auditorium,['2009-10-23 15:00']

Produced by Eric Rosse (Sara Bareilles), the album showcases Hires's voice, an instrument striking in its warmth, expressiveness, and ability to convey a multitude of emotions within a single song. Growing up in Tampa, Matt first gravitated toward punk and post-hardcore music, then discovered the classics -- Tom Petty, the Band, the Byrds, and the Beatles. He put it all together with some fearsome contemporary songwriting chops, and an Atlantic label exec heard his songs and sent him an e- mail that he at first assumed was a prank.
