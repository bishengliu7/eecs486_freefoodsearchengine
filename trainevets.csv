There it blended with elements of Spanish music and was brought back across the seas to North Africa, where it flourished in the cities of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Zafir features virtuoso composer and musical director Simon Shaheen with his group Qantara, acclaimed Tunisian singer Sonia M’barek, flamenco musician Juan Pérez Rodríguez, and the fiery young flamenco dancer Auxi Fernandez, who completes the music with her explosive footwork.",Michigan Theater,['2016-04-15 20:00']

4000,Frog Island Fest Revival,"During The Ark's 45th anniversary year we're reviving the spirit of the annual Frog Island Music Festival. Presented each summer in Ypsilanti's Frog Island Park by WEMU and The Ark from1982 to 2001, it featured diverse musical styles–Jazz, Blues, Zydeco, and other musical styles that grew out of the African American musical heritage. It was known at the time as “the world's biggest block party!” Those who attended remember fun, cultural diversity, unpredictable weather and fantastic music! Wear your summertime festival attire–your vintage Frog Island Festival t-shirt if you have one! Myrick ""Freeze"" Guillory inherited some great songs and a hot band from his mother, Queen Ida (who performed at Frog Island). Freeze is charging ahead to carry on the cultural traditions of zydeco music through high-energy, creative shows. Freeze, who played his first shows with the Queen Ida band in the mid-1970s, has become a featured performer with the group. Although he's committed to the time honored waltzes and peppery two-steps that characterize Ida's shows, Freeze adds some solid rhythm-and-blues numbers to his show, in keeping with one of Zydeco's most important traditions– innovation. Al Hill is a soul singer, a blues piano master, and an outstanding guitarist. His music is rooted in the blues, but pulls freely from soul, country, and jazz. A mainstay of the Detroit music scene for years, he relocated to Nashville in 2008. Don't miss your chance to experience him in a rare local show. The evening will also feature live jazz from the Community High Jazz Combo during a buffet dinner provided by Zingerman's Roadhouse for those at the Gourmet Jazz Picnickers level and up.",,['2010-11-13 20:00']

21357,HE: The Hergott Shepard Photography Collection,"For more than 25 years, Los Angeles-based collectors Alan Hergott and Curt Shepard have built a world-class collection of contemporary art that is focused on men and male identity as its subject matter. This exhibition features works from their vast holdings in photography. Guest curator Mario Codognato examines the lives of men in contemporary Western societies—with all their contradictions—through themes of competition and solidarity, confrontation with identity, and diverse explorations of the body and sexuality (as both sign and experience). Together, these thematic groups form a fictional, somewhat idealized, tale in 13 chapters, inviting viewers to reflect upon their own stories as well. Drawing upon the Hergott Shepard collection as well as select works gifted by the collectors to the Hammer Museum at UCLA, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), the exhibition will include more than 60 works by some of the most important names in late 20th and early 21st century art, including Doug Aitken, John Baldessari, Matthew Barney, Rineke Dijkstra, Gilbert and George, Nan Goldin, Robert Mapplethorpe, Catherine Opie, Herb Ritts, Thomas Ruff, Andres Serrano, and Wolfgang Tillmans.

38479,HET Brown Bag Seminar | Linearized Gravity as a Gauge-Invariant Wave Equation on Kinematic Space,"Kinematic space was originally defined in AdS3 as the space of geodesics. In this talk, I will generalize the concept of kinematic space to higher dimensions. Fields can be defined on this kinematic space, and these fields can be identified with ""OPE blocks,"" contributions to the OPE from a single conformal family. In holographic theories, the OPE blocks are dual at leading order in 1/N to integrals of effective bulk fields along geodesics or homogeneous minimal surfaces in anti-de Sitter space. Thus, these operators pave the way for generalizing the Ryu-Takayanagi relation to other bulk fields. The dynamics of bulk fields are related to the dynamics of kinematic space fields via the intertwining property of integral transformations. In particular, the linearized gravitational equations are shown to be equivalent to a gauge-invariant wave equation on kinematic space.

37896,"The Inauguration of Donald Trump: The Political Issues in the Fight Against Inequality, War, and Dictatorship","Come hear Jerry White, SEP 2016 Presidential Candidate, speak on the fundamental political issues facing the working class in the era of Trump. The inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the United States on January 20 marks a significant political turning point. Trump has assembled a cabinet of billionaires, military generals, and corporate CEOs dedicated to war, the destruction of democratic rights and the eradication of whatever remains of the progressive reforms—achieved through decades of mass struggles—that ameliorated conditions of life for the working class. The election of Trump has exposed, in all its disgusting nakedness, the reality of oligarchic rule in the United States. However, Trump is not some sort of monstrous interloper in what had been, until Election Day 2016, a flawed but essentially decent society. Trump—the product of the criminal and diseased couplings of the real estate, finance, gambling and entertainment industries—is the genuine face of the American ruling class. The Democratic Party is concentrating its criticism of Trump not on his ultra-right wing agenda, but on his alleged “softness” toward Russia, there is a burning necessity for workers and young people to develop a genuine political alternative to the policy of war and social reaction that is being planned.

These musical friends are gathering in concert to share with audiences a musical experience that customarily only happens behind closed doors, whether backstage at a festival or at a Nashville picking party. With each member being a front man in his own right, the band will present an evening of original and classic bluegrass music.

BRYAN SUTTON Bryan Sutton is one of the most sought after acoustic guitarists on the planet. Sutton entered the bluegrass world in 1995 as a member of Ricky Skaggs' Kentucky Thunder band, playing on two Grammy award © -winning records. After his tenure with Skaggs, Bryan went on to build a career as a top studio guitarist in Nashville. His playing can be heard along side such names as Keith Urban, Dolly Parton, Taylor Swift, and Harry Connick Jr.. Bryan has also released four solo projects and toured the world with artists such as Bela Fleck and Chris Thile, and as a member of the legendary bluegrass band, Hot Rize. Sutton is a six-time winner of the IBMA's Guitarist of the Year, and received a Grammy in 2007 for ""Best Country Instrumental Performance"" for his duet recording with Doc Watson. JESSE COBB is a sought after mandolinist known for his strong rhythmic presence and lyrical leads. Jesse has toured extensively in the US and Europe, taught at major festivals and camps, and as a member of The Infamous Stringdusters, has won awards and accolades from the Bluegrass and Americana communities including a Grammy nomination for the band in 2011.

16805,EEB Thursday Seminar Series,"Over 30 years ago, it was learned that the so-called microbial loop in marine planktonic ecosystems is responsible for processing about half of the primary productivity. Since then, a series of discoveries have shown with increasing detail the processes that make up this loop and the organisms involved. Viruses went from being completely unknown and ignored to now known as the most abundant biological entities, with many ecological, biogeochemical, and evolutionary impacts. Results from cloning and sequencing 16S rRNA yielded the totally unexpected result that mesophilic archaea, previously unknown, are remarkably abundant in seawater, with metagenomics and then cultivation showing many are ammonia-oxidizing chemoautotrophs. Patterns in the distribution of microbes is now studied by high-throughput molecular methods. At our 13-year San Pedro Ocean Time Series, we have found repeating seasonal patterns in community composition near the sea surface, though much less in water slightly deeper at the chlorophyll-maximum depth. We developed tools to show Microbial Association Networks, and these are showing many potential interactions among bacteria, archaea, protists, and viruses, with interesting patterns like contrasting network connectivity in bacteria-protist vs bacteria-virus networks.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1200,['2014-04-10 16:00']

30987,Dissertation Defense: Transcriptional Regulation of Autophagy,"Candidate for a PhD in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Abstract: Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a cellular recycling process through which cytoplasmic contents are delivered into the lysosome/vacuole for degradation by double-membrane organelles, autophagosomes. Autophagy is essential for cell survival under stress; however, too much autophagy can also be detrimental. Autophagy activity can be regulated by modulating the size or the number of autophagosomes. Although there are more than 40 autophagy-related (ATG) genes that have been identified, it is not fully understood how most of these genes contribute to these aspects of regulation. Autophagy is highly conserved among eukaryotic cells, and its molecular machinery has been best characterized in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In my thesis studies, I use budding yeast as the model organism, taking advantage of its utility in genetic/genomic screening; in addition, high-throughput sequencing and powerful autophagy assays have been developed uniquely in the yeast system, to explore how autophagy is modulated through transcriptional regulation. When I joined the Klionsky lab, I became involved in the study of a negative transcriptional regulator of autophagy, Ume6. Deletion of the UME6 gene results in an increase in the size, but not the number, of autophagosomes by increasing the expression of Atg8. From a subsequent genetic screen for autophagy modulators, I identified another transcription repressor of autophagy, Pho23. Intriguingly, Pho23 ended up being characterized as a specific regulator of the number, but not the size, of autophagosomes, or it can be viewed as controlling the rate of autophagosome formation by regulating Atg9 expression. These studies support a model whereby the size and numbers of autophagosomes are independently regulated through precise transcriptional regulation of different ATG genes. Collaborating with Amélie Bernard, a postdoc in the lab, to further explore the transcriptional regulation network of autophagy, we analyzed 139 yeast strains each deleted for a single gene encoding a transcription factor; we profiled the transcription of several ATG genes in each strain. Through this screen we identified Gcn4, Slf1, Gat1 and Gln3 as transcriptional activators, and Spt10, Fyv5, and Rph1 as transcriptional repressors of autophagy. We also further investigated the detailed molecular mechanisms of the regulation of autophagy by Rph1.",Map Rackham Graduate School (Horace H.) - Earl Lewis Room,['2016-06-27 10:00']
28705,Mouths of Babes,"With more than a dozen albums and over a thousand shows between them, Ty Greenstein and Ingrid Elizabeth of Mouths of Babes are no strangers to the modern folk music scene. For years, their respective bands Girlyman and Coyote Grace captivated thousands of loyal fans as they crisscrossed the country, rocked festival main stages, and toured with the likes of the Indigo Girls and Dar Williams. Now, as Mouths of Babes, Ty and Ingrid have distilled the very best of the songwriting, humor, and musicianship of their previous groups into a new power duo whose key is contrast. Rarely is a sound or a show as balanced as it is with these two, and the differences in both their songwriting styles and personal presentation makes for an unusually satisfying yin and yang. The Chicago Tribune writes: “They offer unique counterpoints to one another…the laidback Ty, nattily dressed in a tie and crisp suit jacket, has a rich, lovely alto. Ingrid, clad in a sultry pink satin mini-dress, is a sassy chanteuse with a lilting soprano. Trading jokes and sharing elegant harmonies, the two women display an intuitive professional bond.” They easily switch off lead vocals and play a wide array of instruments, with Ty on acoustic and electric guitars, banjo, and foot percussion, and Ingrid playing upright bass, ukulele, and cajón.","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.

Dr. Jayasundera is an ophthalmologist with dual fellowship training in vitreoretinal surgery, retinal dystrophies, electrophysiological testing, and posterior uveitis. His research program focuses on inherited retinal degenerations. His goal is to identify patients at an earlier age to be able to: 1) provide the correct genetic diagnosis, 2) give an  accurate prognosis, 3) help guide the choice of treatment, such as gene therapy, and 4) develop outcome measures which will determine  progression of their disease state in therapeutic trials. He was the first  surgeon in the U.S. to implant the “bionic eye” after FDA approval in January 2014. This is the fourth in a six-lecture series.

36107,Moving Image: Landscape,"Moving Image: Landscape explores traditional notions of landscape through four very different time-based works by artists Jim Campbell, Antti Laitinen, Joanie Lemercier, and Rick Silva. Campbell’s recent body of work, including Seal Rock, presents pixilated images of landscapes created with grids of LEDs. The low-resolution LEDs create a tension between representation and abstraction, provoking viewers to interpret visual information on their own. In the three-channel video It’s My Island Laitinen builds his own island in the Baltic Sea by dragging two hundred sand bags into the water over a period of three months. The work explores ideas of nationality, citizenship, and identity as the artist creates his own single-citizen micro-nation. Lemercier’s computer-generated print Landforms uses patterns of black dots and projected light to create the illusion of three-dimensionality and movement when seen from a distance. The effects are more realistic than a still image, but still unsettlingly artificial. Silva’s Render Garden explores the digitized landscape, including remix and glitch aesthetics, through software that endlessly generates new plant combinations. Throughout the next year UMMA will present a series of exhibitions drawn from the Borusan Contemporary Art Collection in Istanbul. The Borusan’s thirty-year-old collection includes significant works across a variety of genres, and since 2011 it has focused on media arts. The works exhibited here address formal concerns such as abstraction and color, and conceptual topics such as identity or ecological issues; many represent traditional categories such as portraiture and landscape that find new resonance when explored through the strategies of dynamic technology.
