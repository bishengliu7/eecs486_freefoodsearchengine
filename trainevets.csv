In the context of the April 2011 “Dear Colleague Letter” issued as guidance by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, this conference aims to bring together institutional policy makers and community-based sexual assault response professionals to discuss and develop policies addressing student sexual misconduct under Title IX. The conference is designed so that research and promising practices presentations on Day One will inform policy design workshops and policy recommendations on Day Two. We are pleased to announce that John DiPaolo, Chief of Staff of the Office for Civil Rights, will participate in the conference. Campus Sexual Assault Policy: Problems and Progress will focus on not only the impact of the Dear Colleague Letter but also the intersection of diversity with campus policy development. We will explore cultural considerations in policy development and the impact of both campus sexual assault and the policies designed to address sexual violence on diverse survivors. Campus Sexual Assault Policy: Problems and Progress is supported by a grant from the University of Michigan National Center for Institutional Diversity. Additional sponsors include, at UM, the Center for the Education of Women, the CEW Frances and Sydney Lewis Visiting Leaders Fund, Abuse Hurts, the Division of Student Affairs, the Office of Student Conflict Resolution, the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center, the Office of the Vice President and General Counsel, the Office of Institutional Equity, the Women’s Studies Department, the Institute for Research on Women and Gender, the SHARP Center for Women and Girls, the School of Social Work, and the Gerald R.

11378,Foreclosed: Rehousing the American Dream,"""Foreclosed: Rehousing the American Dream"" is an exploration of new architectural possibilities for cities and suburbs in the aftermath of the recent foreclosure crisis. During summer 2011, five interdisciplinary teams of architects, urban planners, ecologists, engineers, and landscape designers worked in public workshops at MoMA PS1 to envision new housing and transportation infrastructures that could catalyze urban transformation, particularly in the country's suburbs. Responding to ""The Buell Hypothesis,"" a research report prepared by the Buell Center at Columbia University, teams – lead by MOS, Visible Weather, Studio Gang, WORKac, and Zago Architecture – focused on a specific location within one of five ""megaregions"" across the country to come up with inventive solutions for the future of American suburbs. This installation presents the proposals developed during the architects-in-residence program through diagrams and videos. This exhibition is a traveling version of the exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (February 15 – August 13, 2012) that was organized by Barry Bergdoll, The Philip Johnson Chief Curator of Architecture and Design with Reinhold Martin, Director, Temple Hoyne Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture Columbia University.

25863,"Datamediation: WikiLeaks, Citizenfour, and the Affectivity of Exposure","In 2010, Julian Assange and WikiLeaks made headlines with major internet releases of classified information, mainly from US government sources. Three years later Edward Snowden was declared a traitor when, with the help of three journalists, he exposed thousands of classified NSA documents. These exposures of classified data have been lauded by open-access advocates and excoriated by US government officials. Discussion of these data dumps has largely focused on the question of their content, or on the legitimacy of releasing confidential information to the globally networked public. In this talk I pursue a different tack, taking up the formal and affective qualities of their releases, the way they function as instances of what I call “datamediation.” Their impact, I argue, derives as much from their perpetuation of an affectivity of exposure as from the content of what they reveal. Grusin is a leading figure in new media studies. He has written both theoretically and interpretively about the relations between new media and old, most recently in Critical Inquiry (“Radical Mediation,” Fall, 2015); previous works include Premediation: Affect and Media After 9/11 (2010) and, with co-author Jay David Bolter, Remediation: Understanding New Media (2000).",Map Angell Hall - 3222,['2015-10-29 16:00']

37742,"Being Killable: Precarization, Violence and Neoliberal Labor in Contemporary Mexico","Over the past two decades, the question of violence in Mexico has occupied a considerable amount of attention in different disciplines across the humanities and social sciences. From the Ciudad Juárez femicides and the harrowing experiences of Central American migrants to the rise of criminal organizations and citizen vulnerability, the experience of violence in neoliberal Mexico has acquired a level of urgency and thus elicited reactive work on the part of scholars in different fields. This paper seeks to systematize the work of scholarship regarding violence in Mexico under the idea of “being killable,” i.e. the dynamics of socialization and subjectification that determine who is the target of violence across the board. Departing from theories of precarization and labor, the paper explores different literary and film works, as well as public interventions and theories, to contend that violence can be read across two axes: the nature of labor in the neoliberal era and the imagination of subjectivity beyond identity. Ignacio M. Sánchez Prado is Professor of Spanish and Latin American Studies at Washington University in Saint Louis. His research centers on the relationship between aesthetics, ideology and cultural institutions in Mexico, with a particular focus on literature and cinema. He is the author of El canon y sus formas.

15627,Music Theory Lecture: Harald Krebs (University of Victoria),"“Declamation in Clara Schumann’s Songs as an Influence on Robert Schumann’s Late Song Style” Clara Schumann composed her first mature songs in the early 1840s, shortly after Robert Schumann’s first outpouring of Lieder. Whereas most of Robert’s songs from this period are simple and predictable in their treatment of all levels of the poetic rhythm, Clara’s songs feature incongruence of poetic and musical stress, overriding of the poem’s lineation, and irregularity of foot duration. Robert Schumann’s late songs (1849-52) contain distortions of the poetic rhythm similar to those in Clara’s songs. Given his familiarity with Clara Schumann’s Lieder (most of which were composed for him), it is likely that her distinctive declamation was an important influence on his late song style. Through analysis of passages from Clara Schumann’s songs and from late songs by Robert Schumann, I demonstrate the declamatory similarities, and also the similar expressive motivations of the two composers’ distortions of the poetic rhythm.

This talk discuss the concept of prosopography and the issues of “crowding attention” in large-scale collective representation, including databases and social media.

As it will demonstrate, the seeds of an independent new musical culture were already planted in the 1860s, after the foundation of the musical equivalent of the Salon des Réfusées – the Théatre Lyrique.

Although many satellite technologies have been successfully scaled down to CubeSat sizes, propulsion remains a major technology gap due to difficulties in miniaturization. But providing a CubeSat with 10s, 100s, or even 1000s of m/s of delta-v would enable a huge variety of new missions for those satellites. For this reason, a variety of technologies are being pursued by universities, government agencies, and commercial entities.

29262,How Sincerity in Literature Was Made: Soviet Children's Writers and the Moral Revival of the Mid-1950s,"It is generally acknowledged that the beginning of the “Thaw” epoch in Soviet literature was marked by the publication of Vladimir Pomerantsev’s article “On sincerity in literature” (December, 1953). There sincerity was interpreted not as a writer’s inclination to “open” his/her inner world to the public, but rather as a moral demand to critically represent the social environment and social conditions. This view acquired wide support in the milieu of reformatory-minded Soviet writers, especially those who specialized in children's literature. This talk is intended to discover what literary plots, images and devices were required and were really used in order to fulfill this moral and social duty and what peculiar and sometimes odd literary forms arose in response to the new imperatives. Maria Maiofis is an Associate Professor and Senior Research Fellow at the School of Advanced Research in the Humanities, Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration. She is the author of Appeal to Europe: the Literary Society “Arzamas” and the Russian Modernization Project of 1815-1818 (in Russian, 2008), and a co-editor of volumes on the history of Soviet children’s and youth culture and education, most recently, Islands of Utopia: Social and Pedagogical Approaches to Modeling Post-WWII School (in Russian, 2015).",Map 202 S.

Jerusalem is an ancient world center in the Judean mountains with a rich and sacred past. As one of the oldest cities in the world, it has witnessed its share of glory and conflict. Jerusalem is a sacred city for all three Abrahamic faiths and serves as Israel’s political capital. Tel Aviv—the “first Hebrew city”—seems to have emerged from the sand dunes of the Mediterranean a century ago. A cosmopolitan hub for tech and trade, home to corporate offices and development centers, Tel Aviv is Israel’s financial capital and a major arts and entertainment center. It has the second-largest economy in the Middle East, and its modern Bauhaus-inspired “White City” is a UNESCO World Heritage site. During your time in Israel, you will explore key sites in the history of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and meet with writers, filmmakers, and other artists living and working in these cities. Discover the ethnic, racial, and cultural diversity of the local populations, which include Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Jews (Jews from Arab countries), religious and secular Jews and Arabs (both Muslim and Christian), and migrant workers.

24600,"Orders of Exchange: Buying Babies in the ""Hippolytus""","In his famously misogynist speech (Eu. Hipp. 616-33), the young Hippolytus suggests that men should be able to produce babies by purchasing them at temples, rather than engaging in sexual intercourse with women. What has not been noticed is that the form of exchange Hippolytus suggests in this passage explicitly avoids the use of coinage, and thus belongs to what Kurke and others have termed the aristocratic, “long-term” order of exchange; at the same moment he suggests that women are “counterfeit coins,” thereby placing sexual reproduction on the side of “short term"" commercial exchange. Built into Hippolytus’ misogyny, then, we can see his self-image as a champion for elitist, anti-democratic discourse — an opposition that resonates throughout the drama in his conflict with Theseus.",Map Angell Hall - 2175 Classics Library,['2015-10-08 16:00']

35749,Applied Interdisciplinary Mathematics,"A substantial body of terramechanics research has been performed at the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) and the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) that led to the development of various mobility prediction methodologies including the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM). These methodologies are numerical algorithms for predicting cross-country vehicle movement at length scales of several meters to several kilometers. They are based on empirical results drawn from years of resource-intensive experimental testing and have been used widely by the military community. As a consequence of their empirical nature, while the methods have been useful for prediction of large, heavy vehicle mobility, they can neither be extrapolated to today's vehicle designs containing advanced technologies nor are applicable to lightweight robotic vehicles. Hence is the need for a physics-based approach that would enable a high fidelity mobility prediction. This research is aimed at augmenting the role that computational multibody dynamics (MBD) plays in characterizing the dynamics of discrete media in terramechanics applications. The discrete element method (DEM) is a powerful, emerging tool for analyzing these phenomena. The use of novel frictional-contact modeling techniques, such as the differential variational inequality (DVI) approach, which complement existing penalty/regularization approaches, in combination with a mapping of the solution algorithms onto commodity massively parallel hardware is envisioned to lead to a major breakthrough in our ability to simulate the dynamics of tracked and wheeled vehicles operating on deformable terrain. The challenge, however, is the computational performance of such approaches in terms of efficiency and robustness which are addressed in this research. The research focuses on the use of second order optimization methods to improve the robustness of the DVI method for large multiscale MBD problems. This research thrust is predicated on the assertion that bringing higher order information into the numerical solution will improve its rate of convergence.

For 2500 years, educators were confident that education not merely taught people useful facts and procedures for solving particular problems, but made people smarter in general. 20th century psychologists were dubious that there was much “transfer” of abilities taught in the classroom to the infinite variety of problems encountered in everyday life. The debate now centers on what is called “critical thinking skills.” Current evidence that higher education produces much in the way of critical thinking skills is mixed at best. But is college getting a bum rap? Is there a more optimistic story to be told – one more in the line with what thinkers from Plato to Dewey believed? And what would we have to do to be certain that college students were really smarter on the way out than they were on the way in?

32260,Wynwood Walls - Art as Ignition: Presenting Jessica Goldman Srebnick with Tristan Eaton and Kashnik,"Dark, gritty, and desolate were words used to describe Miami’s Wynwood neighborhood in 2006. Wanting to revitalize the neighborhood, renowned place-maker, the late property developer and patron of the arts Tony Goldman, saw the natural vocabulary of Wynwood was its hand-painted signage, graphics, and graffiti. In 2009, Wynwood Walls began, arguably the nation’s only outdoor street art museum, open to the public without charge. Composed of six separate warehouses, the exterior walls serve as giant canvases for the greatest street art collection ever assembled in one place. In 2010, the Wynwood Doors were added in what was formerly a junkyard. The culmination of the project is the Wynwood Walls Garden, completed in December 2015. The project expands the privately owned and funded Wynwood Walls Garden to an incredible 45,000 square feet of open space in an urban core. The project has evolved into a living Museum of the Streets, with new murals added each year, attracting hundreds of thousands of people. Since its inception, the space has seen over 70 artists representing 18 countries who have covered over 85,000 square feet of walls, all at the center of a now thriving, diverse, and inspiring neighborhood. Jessica Goldman Srebnick is the CEO of Goldman Properties and the founder of Goldman Global Arts (GGA), an organization that produces impactful, conceptual, and large-scale creative projects. GGA is dedicated to Miami’s emerging Wynwood Arts District, with a key focus on the vitality, aesthetic, and artistic components of all products created by the firm. Tristan Eaton is a graffiti artist, street art muralist, illustrator, and toy designer. Eaton’s large-scale mural work features a meticulous, visual collage of pop imagery executed freehand with spray paint on a colossal scale and can be found in cities across the globe. His work is also part of the Museum of Modern Art NY’s permanent collection. Kashink is one of the few active female artists in the French graffiti/street art scene. She wears a mustache and only paints men, preferably fat and hairy, looking like sensitive gangsters, alien-looking ogres, or shaman from ancient tribes. Inspired by both Hispanic and Slavic origins of pop art, her work considers issues of the absurdity of social interactions through the theme of masks and the various cultural traditions surrounding death.

The same research has struggled to identify the conceptual dimensions people use to make judgments about realism. This talk will briefly present the results of two experiments that look at the thoughts people report having while consuming written and filmic narratives and how those thoughts relate to their scores on perceived realism and narrative engagement scales. Then the thoughts reported will be used as a basis to discuss alternative or additional ways to conceptualize the concepts of perceived realism and unrealism, and how those concepts could be operationalized. Rick Busselle’s research and teaching focuses on how mediated stories influence our perceptions and understandings of social issues related to poverty, crime, addiction, and mental illness. His research focuses specifically on engagement with narratives, perceived realism of stories, and the social construction of reality through media. His work has been published in Communication Theory, Communication Research, and The Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, among other scholarly journals and academic proceedings.",Map North Quad - 2435,['2017-01-26 16:00']

The first topic covers the evolution of Michigan neural probe technologies toward scaling up the number of recording sites, enhancing the recording reliability, and introducing multi-modalities in neural interface. We investigated scaling of probe geometry to reduce probe surface area in the form of lattice probes, while exploring polymer materials for providing flexibility in the shank body to reduce micromotion effects. As a part of multi-modality, we monolithically integrated optical waveguides on the Michigan probe to bring optical stimulation capability in addition to electrical recording for optogenetics study. The second topic covers the microfluidic platforms that my group has developed for robust single cell capture, long-term clonal culture of heterogeneous single cells for drug screening and differentiation study, and selective cell retrieval for further phenotypic and genotypic analysis. A growing body of evidence supports the presence of cancer “stem-like” cells (CSC) in many cancers. In the CSC model only a limited subset of the heterogeneous population actually retains the ability initiate new tumors, grow, and metastasize. Understanding and analyzing this heterogeneity at single cell level is important to improve our basic understanding of cancer biology. The developed platform grants orders of magnitude higher throughput in analyzing single cells than conventional methods. Single-cell retrieval technique will be introduced to selectively release the target single cells with high precision, allowing for characterizing single cell genotype after observing, in assays, the phenotypic responses of the cells.",Map West Hall - 335,['2015-10-14 12:00']

592,EEB Thursday Seminar Series: The importance of scale in Drosophila evolutionary genomics,"Abstract: The molecular evolutionary process is known to be variable, both within and between genomes. However, the scale at which this process varies, and the scale at which factors underlying rates and patterns of molecular evolution vary, remain unclear. Understanding the temporal and physical (i.e., with respect to physical location in the genome) scales over which the evolutionary process and its constituent forces change is critical for addressing evolutionary questions in an appropriate context. To investigate the temporal scale at which single nucleotide substitutional patterns vary, I applied a recently developed maximum likelihood model, capable of estimating lineage-specific rates of single nucleotide substitution, to coding and noncoding sequences in the six sequenced species of the melanogaster group. This analysis provides strong evidence in support of lineage-specific substitutional patterns, suggesting that the assumption of substitutional pattern stability over evolutionary time is flawed. To begin to address the question of physical scale, I focused on recombination rate. Using a classical genetics approach, I examined the fine-scale structure of recombination rate in a 1.2 Mb region of the D. melanogaster X chromosome.

11824,"U-M School of Music, Theatre & Dance Adult Workshop","Faculty: Kevin Korsyn Description: If you love classical music, you probably have a great deal of tacit knowledge about music, even if you have never played an instrument or learned to read musical notation. This course will enable you to access that knowledge by examining some of the fundamental aspects of aural experience, including memory and expectation, musical ambiguity, and feelings of tension and release. Although instructional materials will be provided for those who wish to progress further on their own, even those with no formal musical training and no knowledge of musical notation will enjoy this course. In a series of eight ninety-minute lectures, the course will use powerful and memorable musical events to generalize about musical grammar and logic, featuring works that are familiar to many classical music enthusiasts, such as Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto and Chopin’s “Revolutionary” Etude, all of them played live at the piano by the instructor, Professor Kevin Korsyn of the University of Michigan School of Music, Theater & Dance.

28931,"Health, History, Demography and Development (H2D2)","Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) kills more than 1.5 million people annually and now ranks alongside HIV as the leading infectious disease cause of death worldwide. There have been calls for more drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) prevalence studies yet only 8.3% of the population in high burden countries live in regions with at least two data points to estimate trends. We develop an innovative, low-cost method for estimating disease prevalence that relies solely on routinely-collected data from diagnostic laboratories, provides continuous surveillance and accounts for under-detection. We use TB test result data from South Africa’s National Health Laboratory Service, which includes test records from over 11 million patients, to estimate the prevalence of MDR-TB between 2004-2011. We develop a theoretical model of the clinician’s decision to perform drug susceptibility testing and use a simulated maximum likelihood estimation (SMLE) method and a method of simulated moments (MSM) to estimate model parameters. We estimate that at least one-third of MDR-TB cases went undiagnosed between 2004-2011. The MDR-TB rate in South Africa could be as high as 3.29 - 3.37% and the official World Health Organization estimate of 2.5% based on notification rates is therefore too low. We find that clinician behavior in the province of Mpumalanga is consistent with a sub-optimal approach of MDR testing only after observing the failure of first-line drug therapy. These findings highlight the need for investment in early detection of MDR-TB and more effective treatment. Using routinely collected data to monitor population prevalence rates is an effective low-cost strategy to guide health policy in low resource settings",Map Lorch Hall - 201,['2016-02-16 11:30']

Even individuals with similar levels of brain pathology (measured in vivo or post-mortem) differ substantially in their rates of late-life cognitive decline. I will present studies on putative risk (e.g., depression) and protective (e.g., educational, bilingualism) factors and introduce a resilience framework for investigating the interplay between demographics, psychosocial experiences, and brain markers of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathology. A primary aim of this work is to advance novel approaches to probe mechanisms of racial/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer’s disease. Bio: Dr. Zahodne is a clinical neuropsychologist and an alumna of the University of Michigan. She completed doctoral training at the University of Florida and clinical internship at Brown University. She completed postdoctoral training through the Neuropsychology and Cognition in Aging T32 at Columbia University, where she received a K99 career development award from the National Institute on Aging. Dr. Zahodne’s research focuses on psychosocial influences on cognitive aging and the expression of neurodegenerative disease, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities.

22326,"Jeff Austin Band featuring Danny Barnes, Ross Martin & Eric Thorin","Mandolinist Jeff Austin is unstoppable. He is celebrated for his fleet fingers and penchant for improvisation on stage, but those qualities also speak volumes about how he chooses to live. Jeff has cultivated his natural musical abilities and allowed himself to be driven by his boldest instincts. In 1998, while working at a bar called The Verve in Nederland, Colorado, he and a group of friends formed The Yonder Mountain String Band, which created a wild, high-energy niche between the bluegrass legends of old and the up-and-coming jam band scene. “My time with Yonder has taught me what is possible,” Jeff says. “It has shown me that if you work hard at it and you believe in it and there’s a part of you that’s meant to do it, it will happen. It’s clichéd, but it’s true.” Now Jeff Austin moves into a new creative direction as a solo artist. On his forthcoming debut project, Jeff’s songwriting remains rooted in Americana inspiration and the frantic energy of the jam genre but also, reaches even further weaving in more mainstream themes, reminiscent of his co-write contribution “Fiddlin’ Around,” that was featured on the 2010 Grammy-nominated Dierks Bentley album, ""Up on the Ridge.""","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.

18620,Exhibition: Artistic Impositions in the Photographic Portrait,"Susan Sontag claimed that photographs “owe their existence to a loose cooperation (quasi-magical, quasi-accidental) between photographer and subject.” Any photographic portrait marks an encounter between the person executing the image and the person posing for it. The sixteen photographs included in this exhibition speak to an especially charged collaboration between photographer and model in that they are all portraits of artists. When a photographer is faced with a subject who is so thoroughly invested in artistic representation, how might this impact his or her own photographic aesthetic? In this suite of remarkable photographs, we witness different manifestations of this phenomenon at work. For example, we see results ranging from the surreal to the seemingly straightforward through encounters between Salvador Dalí and Philippe Halsman; Frida Kahlo and Manuel Álvarez Bravo; and Georgia O’Keeffe and Ansel Adams. In other cases the photographer intentionally frames the photographic subject alongside the artist’s own work of art so that they become compelling participants in their own painted or sculptural compositions. This exhibition invites viewers to consider how the difficult task of representing another artist is productively accomplished through the collaborative aesthetic resonances discernable between model and photographer in these portraits.

32302,Commutative Algebra,"The F-signature of a local ring, a numerical invariant shown to always exist by Tucker, is the asymptotic measurement of the number of Frobenius splittings for which a local ring of prime characteristic admits. The F-signature serves as a measurement of singularities. Most notably, the F-signature of a local ring is 1 if and only if the ring is regular, by work of Huneke and Leuschke, and the F-signature of a local ring is positive if and only if the ring is strongly F-regular, by work of Aberbach and Leuschke. I will discuss how the notion and existence of F-signature extends to all rings which are F-finite but not necessarily local. Our methods our made meaningful by extending Huneke's and Leuschke's and Aberbach's and Leuschke's theorems to the non-local case. This is based on joint work with Alessandro De Stefani and Yongwei Yao. Speaker(s): Thomas Polstra (University of Missouri)",Map East Hall - 3096,['2016-09-08 15:00']

Both chance and intention play a part in these encounters, and the consequences can remain like footprints on the paths of our lives. Crossing Dates mixes three separate stories that take place over two days. The characters’ paths intersect, and they affect each other unintentionally. The three stories are united not only by the characters but also by re-readings of the same theme in different registers.",Map Museum of Art - Helmut Stern Auditorium,['2011-09-17 15:30']
