34601,"CM-AMO Seminar | The Cyanobacterial Circadian Clock, from Test Tube to Cell","All plants and animals and many unicellular organisms possess circadian clocks-autonomous oscillators with a roughly 24 hour period that allow them to anticipate daily cycles of light and dark. I will discuss recent progress on understanding one such biological clock, in the photosynthetic bacterium S. elongatus. This system has the remarkable feature that the core biochemical oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro with only three purified proteins. Thus, unlike almost all other circadian clocks studied to date, it requires neither transcription nor translation but functions entirely post-translationally. After reviewing what we know about how the in vitro oscillator functions, as well as a few outstanding puzzles, I will turn my attention to the implications of this understanding for clock function in the living cell. In particular, I will argue that the core post-translational oscillator is necessary to make the clock robust to several perturbations present in any growing, dividing cell, but that other specific adaptations are also required. These include negative feedback on the transcription of clock components and the presence of several identical copies of the bacterial chromosome in the same cell. I will conclude by suggesting that, far from being an isolated case, the workings of the circadian clock built entirely on protein modifications actually point the way towards a new understanding of a number of other oscillatory biological systems, which can all be thought of as examples of a new class of ""molecular synchronization oscillators.""",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-11-15 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
37145,HET Seminars | The Future is Stochastic (Probably),"Precision calculations in de Sitter space (such as of inflationary predictions for primordial fluctuations) are often plagued by infrared problems and issues of secular time dependence. Similar issues about the breakdown of perturbation theory seem also to arise for information loss in black holes. This talk briefly summarizes how similar problems can arise in other areas of physics, and how they are dealt with when they do. It is argued that Master-Equation techniques used in areas like optics also apply to cosmology (and possibly black holes) and can tell us how to extract reliably late-time predictions. Applied to inflation they lead to Starobinsky's stochastic methods (plus small but important corrections). This is argued to provide an explanation for why stochastic inflation seems to resum IR effects in simple examples, and allows these tools to be generalized to apply more broadly. I mention in passing the relevance of these tools to the problem of Schrodinger's Cosmologist: how primordial fluctuations decohere sometime between their production during inflation and their observation early in the present Big Bang Epoch.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-01-20 15:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

These father-daughter metalogues are exercises in how subjects and objects fuse through the dialectical play of conversational structure. At their best, they exemplify how evolutionary complexities are no less emergent processes than the dialogical attempts to reveal them. Inspired by Bateson’s playful excursions into knowledge production, my foray into the material and affective ‘what-ness’ of bells–their relational ontologies–starts with a series of listening conversations with my daughter, Clochanda, and two of her good friends, Mikhail Bakhtin and Michel Foucault.

Science and Technology employers know that with a physics training, a potential hire has acquired a broad problem-solving skill set that translates to almost any environment, as well as an ability to be self-guided and -motivated so that they can teach themselves whatever is needed to be successful at achieving their goals. Therefore it’s no surprise that the majority of physics graduates find employment in private--sector, industrial settings. At the same time, only about 25% of graduating PhDs will take a permanent faculty position--yet academic careers are usually the only track to which students are exposed while earning their degrees.

Among monogamous prairie voles, vasopressin receptor (avpr1a) levels in brain regions related to spatial memory predict male space-use and sexual fidelity in the field. We find that trade-offs between the benefits of male fidelity and infidelity are reflected in patterns of territorial intrusion, offspring paternity, avpr1a expression and the evolutionary fitness of alternative avpr1a alleles. DNA variation at the avpr1a locus includes polymorphisms that reliably predict the epigenetic status and neural expression of avpr1a, while patterns of DNA diversity demonstrate avpr1a regulatory variation has been favored by selection. In prairie voles, trade-offs in the fitness consequences of social behaviors seem to promote neuronal and molecular diversity.",Map East Hall - 4464,['2017-03-21 12:00'],"['Biology', 'Colloquium', 'Free', 'Psychology']"

A gun entered the exchange, and one of them was left dead. Michael Dunn fired 10 bullets at a car full of unarmed teenagers and then fled. Three of those bullets hit 17-year-old Jordan Davis, who died at the scene. Arrested the next day, Dunn claimed he shot in self-defense. Thus began the long journey of unraveling the truth. 3 ½ Minutes, Ten Bullets follows that journey, reconstructing the night of the murder and revealing how hidden racial prejudice can result in tragedy. 3 ½ Minutes, Ten Bullets illustrates the harrows of the current racial climate within America and why Black Lives Matter.",Map North Quad - RM 2435,['2016-02-09 20:00'],"['African american', 'Discussion', 'Film', 'Free', 'Media', 'Multicultural', 'Politics', 'Social justice']"

14508,The Choice of Heterosexuality: The Porn Industry in France (1975-2010),"In the middle of the 1970s, the porn industry emerged in France, tolerated by a liberal government and regulated by new legal provisions. Since then, French pornographers have presented themselves as fantasy entrepreneurs: in their view, their professional role is to capture and respond to consumers’ various desires. This largely male-dominated trade has a gendered and sexual organization: women are excluded from the market, and there is a clear split in the industry between gay and straight porn. Although pornographers present this divide as being obvious, Dr. Trachman argues that it must be seen as a choice. As “lesbian” scenes in straight porn show, this exclusion concerns only male homosexuality. While pornographers highlight the distance between their own sexuality and the fantasies they put on screen, gay scenes remain an exception.",Map Lane Hall - 2239,['2013-09-25 16:00'],"['Free', 'French', 'Lgbt', 'Lgbtq', 'Lgbtq issues', 'Lgqri', 'Multicultural', 'Sex', 'Sexuality']"

38166,Conference: Standing with Spain: Anti-Fascist Student Activism and the Spanish Civil War,"From 1936 to 1939, large numbers of U-M students mobilized to support the Spanish Republic as it fought a military uprising backed by Hitler and Mussolini. They joined an international movement that sought to make Spain the “tomb of fascism.” In the Michigan Daily, news of the Spanish war unfolded on the front pages, and debates erupted in the op-ed section. The Student Senate passed a resolution urging the U.S. government to lift the embargo on selling arms to Spain. Students formed an aid committee, held rallies, and raised funds to send an ambulance to Spain. Three students volunteered for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and fought in Spain, one of whom would never return. In this conference students will present their original research on anti-fascist student activism at U-M. All events are free and open to the public.

18620,Exhibition: Artistic Impositions in the Photographic Portrait,"Susan Sontag claimed that photographs “owe their existence to a loose cooperation (quasi-magical, quasi-accidental) between photographer and subject.” Any photographic portrait marks an encounter between the person executing the image and the person posing for it. The sixteen photographs included in this exhibition speak to an especially charged collaboration between photographer and model in that they are all portraits of artists. When a photographer is faced with a subject who is so thoroughly invested in artistic representation, how might this impact his or her own photographic aesthetic? In this suite of remarkable photographs, we witness different manifestations of this phenomenon at work. For example, we see results ranging from the surreal to the seemingly straightforward through encounters between Salvador Dalí and Philippe Halsman; Frida Kahlo and Manuel Álvarez Bravo; and Georgia O’Keeffe and Ansel Adams.

The university, of course, will celebrate its bicentennial, while the Residential College will proudly mark its 50th year. Indeed, reaching this milestone provides a wonderful opportunity to reflect on the RC’s evolution and its many accomplishments over this half-century. We can gain valuable perspective on this milestone by recalling something of the intellectual and political moment from which the RC emerged. Pivotal developments of that year that shocked and shaped the world in 1967 continue to have enduring impacts today. This talk will suggest the value in reconsidering selected events of that momentous year—including the Arab-Israeli War, the Detroit Rebellion, and Martin Luther King’s speech, “Beyond Vietnam”—and use this to offer some thoughts on the unfolding of intellectual and political currents since 1967.

Given their small size, their effects on cosmological observables are negligible. We demonstrate that primordial axion stars can accumulate a cloud of baryons. Furthermore, this cloud of baryons could reach a sufficiently dense state that it can burn axions and become hot. This leads to potential point source observables with a blackbody spectrum peaked over a range of frequencies depending on the axion star properties.",Map Randall Laboratory - 3481,['2016-11-16 12:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

Among several viable options, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are motivated dark matter candidates that can be tested by different and complementary search strategies. Crucially, different searches probe WIMP couplings at different energy scales, and such a separation of scales has striking consequences in connecting different experimental probes. This motivates the development of theoretical tools to properly connect the different energy scales involved in constraining WIMP models. I will introduce these tools and I will illustrate with several examples how crucial the inclusion of these effects in WIMP searches is.",Map Randall Laboratory - 3481,['2017-03-29 12:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

Kahn Distinguished University Professor of Business Administration and Psychology at Michigan Ross. SESSION DESCRIPTION: Most people want to work in a positive organization. Yet turning an organization positive is a most difficult challenge. Relationships, teams, organizations and communities are governed by conventional cultures that naturally resist positive change. In this presentation Bob will draw tools from his new book, The Positive Organization. The audience will have the opportunity to use the tools in real time, and create their own practical paths to positive organizing. ROBERT E. QUINN holds the Margaret Elliot Tracey Collegiate Professorship at the University of Michigan and serves on the faculty of Organization and Management at Michigan Ross. He is one of the co-founders of the Center for Positive Organizations. Quinn’s research and teaching focus on leadership, organizational change and effectiveness. He has published 18 books on these subjects. His best-selling book, Deep Change has sold over 100,000 copies. His book, The Best Teacher in You won the Ben Franklin Award designating it the best book in education for 2015. His latest book is The Positive Organization: Breaking Free of Conventional Cultures, Constraints and Beliefs. He is particularly known for his work on the competing values framework. It has been used by organizations across the globe and thousands of managers have been trained in the use of the Framework. He has thirty-five years of experience consulting with major corporations and government agencies. He is a fellow of the Academy of Management and the World Business Academy.

38514,Faculty Recital: Stephen Rush,"On the Vernal Equinox of this year, Professor Rush will attempt to re-define or destroy the idea of the piano recital through an event he calls “Piano Circus.” The concert consists of a wide variety of music, including classic European avant-garde “hits” Evryali by Xenakis, Klavierstücke XI by Stockhausen, and Catalogue of the Birds (Book V) by Messiaen. Additional music by American composers Stevie Wonder, John Coltrane, Meredith Monk, John Cage, Tom Waits, Charles Ives, and Rush. The audience will experience the concert twice (or more), through 8-channel audio diffusion, with chopped-up playback of each piece, played over the actual performance by Rush himself. In other words, the music will be digitally parsed and played randomly (in small gestures) against the performance of the recital itself. To make matters even more interesting, the audience gets to select the order of the recital/circus by polling here: myumi.ch/aXwnp. The concert is under an hour, suitable for all ages, and seating is limited to 80. Please arrive early.",Map Earl V.

20871,Penny Stamps Speaker Series: Tacita Dean,"Tacita Dean’s film portraits express something that neither painting nor photography can capture. They are purely film. Dean‘s art is carried by a sense of history, time and place, light quality and the essence of film itself. The focus of her subtle but ambitious work is the truth of the moment, the film as a medium and the sensibilities of the individual. Dean’s solo exhibitions include Tate Britain, London; Schaulager, Basel; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; Nicola Trussardi Foundation, Milan; and MUMOK, Vienna. She was awarded the Hugo Boss Prize in 2006 and the Kurt Schwitters Prize in 2009. In 2011, she made FILM as part of the Unilever series of commissions in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, which marked the beginning of her campaign to protect the medium of photochemical film (savefilm.org). Other recent exhibitions include dOCUMENTA, Venice Biennale, Berlin Biennale and Biennale of Sydney.",Michigan Theater,['2015-03-26 17:10'],"['Art', 'Education', 'Film', 'Free', 'Lecture', 'Media', 'Visual arts']"
34607,HET Brown Bag Seminar | Projective Geometry of Scattering Amplitudes,"I will introduce a technique in studying the analytic structure of perturbative S-matrix of QFTs. The main idea is to associate Feynman integrals to objects in a projective space: polytopes and hypersurfaces. At one loop, this reveals a universal structure for all possible Feynman integrals (in particular, including one-loop amplitudes in any QFTs), and gives rise to two simple algebraic algorithms to determine the integrals (as functions of the kinematics). I will also comment on the generalization to higher loop levels.",Map Randall Laboratory - 3481,['2016-11-02 12:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
