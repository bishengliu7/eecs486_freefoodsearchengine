Taylor is a professor of Environmental Justice at SNRE. She also is founder and director of the Multicultural Environmental Leadership Development Initiative, which aims to increase diversity in environmental organizations as well as the broader environmental movement. It also promotes greater diversity in leadership in the environmental field. Her lecture is titled ""Race, Poverty, and Access to Food in America: Resistance, Survival, and Sustainability."" It begins at 5 p.m. in Room 1040, Dana Building. The lecture will be followed by a question-and-answer session and is open to the public. Her research interests include urban agriculture and food security; green jobs; social movement analysis; environmental justice; leisure and natural resource use; poverty; and race, gender, and ethnic relations. Taylor is the principal investigator on a five-year, $4 million study of disparities in access to healthy food across the state. The researchers will interview residents and study data in 18 small to mid-sized cities to better understand the factors affecting ""food security,"" a socioeconomic term that defines easy access to safe and healthy food. And because urban agriculture is seen as part of the solution to food insecurity in cities, the researchers will study how locally grown food can more easily get to the poor, traditionally minority, populations most at risk. ""The study will give us an opportunity to get an in-depth understanding of several types of food systems in the state,"" Taylor said. ""The study is unique in that we will examine aspects of the food system that are necessary to connect food to consumers more efficiently."" Other recent research activities have included an analysis of the green jobs sector and four national studies of racial and gender diversity in the environmental field. Her 2009 book, ""The Environment and the People in American Cities,"" is an award-winning urban environmental history book. In 2010, she completed an edited volume titled, ""Environment and Social Justice: An International Perspective."" And she just completed a book to be published in 2013 titled, ""Why Don’t They Move? Race, Space, Residential Mobility, and Environmental Hazards.""

14435,CSAS Scholarly Lecture Series,"Amita Baviskar, Associate Professor of Sociology, Institute of Economic Growth In the last three decades, although India has witnessed radical shifts in the modes of producing and consuming food, this has stimulated surprisingly little analytical attention. The changing political economy of food production and consumption and its role in reshaping social identities and agrarian environments remains remarkably understudied. This lecture outlines the preliminary contours of a project that attempts to analyze some of these shifts through a selective discussion of changing food practices in post-Independence western India. It delineates the widening circuits of food as a commodity form within the home and outside, spanned by the growth of processed foods and practices of 'eating out'. It outlines the changing signification of food practices for different social groups, and considers some potential health and ecological implications arising from the transformation. It makes the case for focused attention on food as a way of understanding social change in India.",Map School of Social Work Building - 1644,['2013-09-17 16:00'],"['Food', 'India', 'Sociology']"

17871,Sports and the University,"Sport is deeply interwoven with institutions of higher education in America today. Sports—as intramural and intercollegiate activities for students, as a segment of the entertainment industry within American society, as cultural objects of intense popular interest and media coverage, and as research subjects for faculty and students in a varied and expanding range of disciplines, whether at major public research institutions or small, private liberal arts colleges—are indisputably a central aspect of the landscape of American higher education. The value of sport in the university context, however, is not beyond dispute.On the contrary, as sports play an ever greater role in higher education and in American society, debates have arisen, on the pages of daily newspapers and specialized academic journals, about their role and the costs and benefits they carry—from financial to educational, physical to cultural to moral. These questions, furthermore, intersect in complex ways with broader social issues related to gender, race, and sexual orientation, and the symposium will seek to shed light on the ways in which approaches to and assessments of the question of value change when these factors are taken into account.

Items are drawn from U-M Library's Janice Bluestein Longone Culinary Archive.

In addition, it analyzes the Chupacabras as a subversive image, used to unify and address the struggles of small farmers, as a sophisticated polysemic entity, that illustrates the insatiable “blood sucking” appetite and predatory practices of neo-liberalism as implemented by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the 1990s.",Map Kelsey Museum of Archaeology - 125,['2014-09-16 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Food', 'Free', 'History', 'Lecture', 'Multicultural', 'Reception', 'Social']"

Professor in Social Work and Psychiatry, Faculty Associate, Research Center for Group Dynamics, Institute for Social Research Continuing Education credits for Social Workers are available; light refreshments will be provided. FREE! Abstract: College-aged black men experience higher levels of psychological distress due to their exposure to a greater frequency and severity of stress compared to other groups. For example, for more than a decade, mental health professionals have been concerned about the disproportionate increase in suicide among adolescent and young adult black males, because males account for 80% of the suicides among blacks. The frequency and severity of psychosocial stressors are exacerbated by other socio-demographic factors (i.e., age, household income, marital status, education level) that can influence the emotional and psychological health of black men. Likewise, studies have chronicled the psychological distress of young black men as a result of discrimination, negative attitudes toward the criminal justice system, racial and cultural identity, depression, violence, and issues involving their masculine gender norms. Research on black men in college is conflicting, as many studies underscore the benefits of educational achievement, while others focus on the challenges associated with gaining social capital and “upward mobility.” In this presentation, Professor Daphne C. Watkins (UM Social Work and Psychiatry) will discuss her research on young black men, masculinities, and how this influences their stress and ability to succeed. She will also discuss future directions in this area, such as her new Young black men, masculinities, and mental health (YBMen) project.",Map Michigan Union - Anderson Room of the Michigan Union,['2014-10-31 10:30'],"['African american', 'Alumni', 'Athletics', 'Detroit', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Food', 'Free', 'Greek life', 'Social justice']"

19758,8th Annual U-M Diabetes Health Fair,"Whether you or a family member has diabetes -- or if you are just concerned about eating healthier -- you can get great diabetes information and sample some healthy dishes at the 8th Annual U-M Diabetes Health Fair on Saturday, November 8, 2014, sponsored by the U-M Comprehensive Diabetes Center. The U-M Diabetes Health Fair is open from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm at the Sheraton Ann Arbor Hotel at 3200 Boardwalk, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 (I-94 State Street exit 177). The fair is free and open to the public. No pre-registration is necessary. The annual healthfest marks the American Diabetes Association’s American Diabetes Month and the United Nations’ World Diabetes Day. This year, there will be a special Cooking Demo with Food Network Chef Curtis Aikens at noon, in addition to the other free offerings. The U-M Diabetes Health Fair will have six types of free health screenings, dozens of information tables, and free presentations on diabetes topics. New this year, a Crafts Corner for kids will be offered (parents must attend with their child). The event’s master of ceremonies is Brandon Roux, WDIV-TV Channel 4 meteorologist (photo left), who has type 1 diabetes (formerly called juvenile diabetes). Roux, who was diagnosed at the age of 26, has been outspoken about his disease and has filmed newscasts about U-M’s research into the causes of type 1 diabetes. Chef Curtis Aikens (photo right), known for his work on The Food Network and other television shows, will host a Novo Nordisk Diabetes Academy Cooking Demo from 12:00 to 1:00 pm. The audience will be able to sample several dishes that he creates, and recipe cards will be given out for the dishes. A registered dietitian/certified diabetes educator will begin the presentation by speaking about healthy eating for people with diabetes. Aikens, who himself has type 2 diabetes, began his national TV career as a chef on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” where he was dubbed “the greengrocer who can cook.” He is one of the founding hosts of The Food Network, where he shared healthy recipes on shows such as “Food in a Flash,” and demonstrated how to use fresh produce on “Pick of the Day” and “Meals Without Meat.” Curtis lives by the motto “practice makes permanent,” and encourages others to make a lifestyle choice of eating healthy without sacrificing flavor. The purpose of the diabetes health fair is to inform the public about managing all forms of diabetes: type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes, and diabetes in pregnancy (gestational diabetes), as well as about handling diabetes complications — and, ideally, how to avoid complications and prevent type 2 diabetes.

20671,Uncanny Valley,"Gallery Opening Reception Guy Michael Davis and Katie Parker (collaboratively working under the name Future Retrieval) The objects presented merge the strengths of our studio practice – a dark vein backed by a historical current. Ornament and detail collide with a fascination of taxidermy and natural order. Each object contains a history, reaching back and highlighting ideals of time and labor. Three-dimensional scans and photographs have been rapid prototyped, processed in the studio, and molded into porcelain mimicking the world of European decorative arts. Inspired also by German animal sculptures and cut silhouettes, we are using digital translation to both highlight and transform these details that fascinate us. The interest in new technologies and industrial methods is that each piece is handmade, but maintains the record of a computer driven interpretation. Our intention is to make art objects that reference design and are held together by craft. Bio Future Retrieval Guy Michael Davis was born in 1978 and raised in Bartlesville, OK. Katie Parker was born in 1980 in Jonesboro Arkansas, and grew up in Plano, Texas. They both attended the Kansas City Art Institute from 1999-2003 and received BFA degrees in ceramics. Katie went straight to graduate school at The Ohio State University from 2003-2005, Guy followed suit three years later from 2006-2008. Both Katie and Guy received MFA degrees in ceramics. Currently, Katie is an Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati, running the ceramics department. Guy works for multiple designers across the country, and is an adjunct Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati. For several years, they have also been collaborating together, making objects that combine new technology, porcelain, and good craft. The objects merge the strengths of their individual studio practice – a dark vein backed by a historical current. They have exhibited both nationally and internationally, with recent shows in New York City, Jingdezhen China, Cardiff Wales, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Tempe Arizona. This summer they were both artists in residence at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Art in Omaha, NE.",Map East Quadrangle - RC Art Galllery,['2015-02-20 17:00'],"['Art', 'Food', 'Free', 'Visual arts']"

We will also have a sexual assault awareness installation by I Will, a journal group led by a NELP alum, a photo booth, and more! VANGUARDS 2015: Voice The University of Michigan has historically been a haven for activism and social change, offering the perfect environment to stand up and make your voice heard. In the past, these movements have created community and brought people together. This year there has been a resurgence of activism, but instead of bringing people together, this movement has focused on our differences instead of focusing on what we have in common. Within each of our distinct races and social identities, we are all students, and more importantly, we are all artists. VANGUARDS: VOICE seeks to bring people from every part of campus together, with art as the common medium, to remind us that we share this common thread. | ABOUT FOKUS | FOKUS nurtures success in communities by exposing community members to unexpected art experiences. This exposure helps them discover their own creativity and use it to better their communities. One driving force of the organization is to highlight the fact that art plays a role in everything from education to entertainment to activism to health to community building and much more. We believe that the arts enable people to rise above barriers in society by creating new ways of thinking, communicating and interacting. FOKUS’s mission is to educate, empower and unite communities through the arts. | WHAT IS VANGUARDS? | VANGUARDS is an annual event that started in April of 2005 that is produced by FIGHTING OBSTACLES KNOWING ULTIMATE SUCCESS (FOKUS). Modeled with respect to a classic block party, Vanguards is FOKUS’s flagship event, showcasing and introducing the FOKUS vision of inclusivity, fun, creativity, and collaborative learning to a wide array of students, professors, staff, and Ann Arbor community. | ENTERTAINMENT | This year we are bringing out several performers. Headlining the event will be Detroit-based singer and guitarist Mayaeni, who is signed to RocNation Records and is the Midwest’s most up-and-coming artist. CityWide Poets, a Detroit-based poetry troupe composed of high school students, will accentuate Vanguards with a main stage performance. Drop-in workshops, student performances, and collaborative activities with other student led organizations will round out the event. After the event, we will create a portfolio of visual, spoken, and written expressions of voice shared at VANGUARDS 2015.",Map Diag - Central Campus,['2015-04-11 13:00'],"['Art', 'Concert', 'Culture', 'Dance', 'Detroit', 'Festival', 'Food', 'Free', 'Games', 'Multicultural', 'Music', 'Networking', 'Outdoors', 'Poetry', 'Social justice', 'Storytelling', 'Visual arts', 'Writing']"

23824,Non-Deductive Argumentation in Classical Chinese Philosophy,"One longstanding criticism of Chinese thought is that is not truly “philosophical” because it lacks viable protocols of argumentation. Thus it qualifies at best as “wisdom”; Confucius, for example, might provide valuable guidance, or thoughtful epigrams to ponder, but nothing in the way of formal reasoning that would permit his audience to reconstruct and reconsider his arguments in any conceivable context. This criticism stands only if one accepts the premise that all argumentation must be deductive argumentation. (This claim does not require any unusual definition of “deduction”; the Aristotelian definition is as good as any.) For it is true that the most famous Chinese arguments tend to be non-deductive in nature. This paper will survey the types of non-deductive argumentation commonly found in Chinese philosophy. One of the most prolific types of non-deductive argumentation is appeal to example, and this, I contend, is the basis of the strong interest in anecdotes as a genre of philosophical literature from the Springs and Autumns at least through the Six Dynasties. There are important examples of deductive argumentation as well, which will be briefly reviewed. Whether these observations are sufficient to rescue Chinese thought from the wilderness of “wisdom” and enshrine it in the halls of “philosophy” will be left for the reader to decide, but a conception of “philosophy” that can account for Chinese thought is naturally more interesting than one that cannot. Paul R. Goldin is Professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania. His main research focus is Warring States China (ca. 5th-3rd centuries B.C.), with interdisciplinary interests in history,archaeology, art history, literature, philosophy, and religion. He is the author of Confucianism (2011), After Confucius: Studies in Early Chinese Philosophy (2005), The Culture of Sex in Ancient China (2002), and Rituals of the Way: The Philosophy of Xunzi (1999). In addition, he has edited or co-edited the Dao Companion to the Philosophy of Han Fei (2012), the Hawai’i Reader in Traditional Chinese Culture (2005), and the new edition of R.H. van Gulik’s Sexual Life in Ancient China (2003).",Map Michigan League - Koessler Room,['2015-09-23 12:00'],"['Chinese studies', 'Food', 'Free', 'Philosophy']"
23825,"Edges, Boundaries and Sliding Scales of Tradition","Improvising physical and verbal language to create encounters around difference and shared traits, Amy Chavasse will imagine a new choreography that comments on edges, boundaries and sliding scales found in American and Chinese contemporary dance forms. Using the presentation as a site for building first steps towards a new duet with Zhang Peng, a choreographer and vocalist from the Tujia region of Southwestern Hunan province, a dialogue will open, and reveal questions around edges, boundaries and sliding scales. The audience will be enlisted to participate. This presentation will unfold in real time, using preconceived structures and premises to reach something unknown. About the speaker: Amy Chavasse, continues to find endless sources of pleasure and wonderment collaborating with many performers, designers and dance makers as Artistic Director of ChavasseDance&Performance, including Peter Schmitz, Malcolm Tulip, Austin Selden, Alex Springer, Xan Burley, and Caroline Chavasse.

23837,Object Lessons in Class and Class Struggle,"In Gejiu, a tin-mining town in southern Yunnan, cultural workers in the 1970s created an Exhibition on the History of Class Struggle in the Gejiu Tin Mines and a Recollect Bitterness Center. These joint exhibitions became the premier “classrooms” for class education in Yunnan province, instructing as many as a thousand visitors a day. During the 1950s, cultural workers in Gejiu had authenticated the local truth of Chinese Marxist history by displaying personal stories of capitalist exploitation, rags worn by miners in the inhumane “old society,” and drawings of worker uprisings. The exhibitions they created during the Cultural Revolution added historical reenactment as a new technique of political instruction. Historical reenactment primarily took the form of yiku (“recollecting bitterness”), narratives about oppression and liberation recited by the elderly. The practice of yiku invoked the older, powerful practice of suku (“venting grievances”), a method of class struggle during the land reforms of the 1940s and 1950s. Written renditions and live performances of yiku featured prominently in class education exhibitions, amplified by the artwork and the display of pre-liberation artifacts. This historical reenactment enjoined visitors to “learn through experience” (tihui) the exploitation, oppression, revolt, and liberation of the Chinese proletariat. The Recollect Bitterness Center even recreated the very time and space of the narrated events. Crawling through an old mine shaft and emerging upright into the light, visitors to the Center performed the metaphorical choreography of emancipation and its structure of historical memory. This instilment of perceptual knowledge about the nature of classes and the meaning of proletarian revolution produced an embodied understanding of Chinese Marxist history, interpolated new political subjects, and incited socialist construction.

Dr. Dhar will present key insights from her monograph Violence, Knowledge and the Female Body: Interrogating Rape Narratives; a forthcoming co-edited volume Education in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Islands; as well as an article on feminist theory, comparative religion, and love. Dr. Dhar’s transdisciplinary research explores, though the lens of gender, the intersections between disciplines, epistemic frames, theory and praxis, in order to ask critical questions pertaining to gender, sexual violence, and education. The talk will interrogate how hegemonic understandings of “bodies” — seen in terms of both gender and knowledge — frame and mediate national and transnational initiatives on sexual violence and education. Dr. Dhar is particularly interested in situating these initiatives within the difficult dialogues between “the east” and “the west,” in light of past and present colonial practices, to examine the possibilities and limitations of love as a (feminist) method.

32376,Dream as “Being”: Du Liniang and Her Field of “Being”,"This discussion focuses on a tragic heroine Du Liniang in the novel The Peony Pavilion(1598) written by Tang Xuanzu (1550-1616). For several centuries from the Ming and to the Qing dynasty, The Peony Pavilion moved many readers and audiences for many years, particularly female audiences at the final scene when they learned about the tragic fate of Du Liniang. In this presentation, Professor Zou will delve into Du Liniang’s character, a woman who lived under the extremely strict constraint on her living space and spiritual world, both from ideological pressure and constraints on her body. Professor Zou explained that Du Liniang is not a “being” because she is alienated from the real word until she enters a condition of boundless life (death) and starts to have a song of her own, a song that signifies “being.” *Image: Du Liniang and her “being” in three zones Biography ZOU Yuanjiang is Professor of Philosophy and a supervisor of doctoral degree candidates at Wuhan University. Professor Zou is the director of the Chinese Aesthetic Society; President of the Hubei Academy of Aesthetics; Chinese Opera Society Executive Director; Vice President of Tang Xianzu Research Association; and Tang Xianzu Research editor in chief.

32789,Mei Lanfang and Twentieth Century Peking Opera: Transcultural Exchanges,"Mei Lanfang’s visit and performances abroad brought him to Japan in 1919, to the United States in 1930, and to the Soviet Union in 1935. While these performances helped introduce Peking Opera abroad and earned Mei Lanfang universal praise and admiration, they more importantly gave Peking opera an opportunity to highlight, for international audiences, its new cultural identity, to present its art as a modern aesthetic system, and to project its claim to historical authenticity. The Peking opera presented there was not a form preserved from time immemorial, but the outcome of an intense ideological debate among the younger generation of the cultural elite within China as to the validity of traditional Chinese theater with the most radical opinion denouncing Peking opera as the dregs of traditional society, bond up with everything dispicable of the old social order and values, and their opponents boldly claiming the modern relevancy of the form by actively engaging with international performing arts as present in Europe, the US and Japan. Mei Lanfang’s carefully prepared international tours with the radically reformed Peking opera were to decide this debate and the domestic fate of genre altogether through international recognition by audiences that included foreign cultural elite and much of the international avant-garde. In this sense, these tours were the catalyst and the crowning glory of the modernization of the genre. The talk will explore these tours in the context of the shifting self- definition, self-narration and self-historization of Peking opera in its struggle to become China’s “national opera.” *Image:“Mei Lan-fang, China’s Greatest Actor Here for His American Premiere.” Drawing, 1930.

32829,"Friends VS. Enemies: Diplomacy Documentary, Espionage Film, and the Persistence of Class in Cold War China","This talk draws from both documentary films consolidating international friendships and espionage films uncovering hidden enemies to situate cinema at the center of manufacturing class visibility and certainty in a Cold War environment where identities and alliances were in constant flux. Flourishing in the 1950s and early 1960s, espionage films mapped class differences onto bodily practices, sensorial experiences and the urban space, just when political and economic changes had gradually eliminated the foundations of class politics. The persistence of the spectre of class in China’s socialist space, then, must be read in relation to Cold War anxieties of national security and anti-revolutionary infiltration. Indeed, as the Sino-Soviet brotherhood and Sino-Indonesian honeymoon, both celebrated on screen, ended in deepened international hostility and China’s ideological hardening, we see a triple crisis of domestic politics, international relations and visual representation. Diplomacy documentary descended into compulsive repetition and hysterical excess to bolster new screen friendships, for example, that with Albania. Viewing positions from espionage films were applied to real-life political struggles, most telling in using documentary “evidence” to incriminate Liu Shaoqi and Wang Guangmei for their alleged defection. Moving between documentary and fiction, domestic class politics and Cold War geopolitics, this talk attempts to think through the persistence and hardening of the notion of class in a socialist China through the central mediation of cinema.Through textual analysis and historical investigation, this paper argues that cinema’s power in the PRC had deep connections to the country’s spiritual traditions, displacing and re-assembling it to create a new society. *Image: Wang Guangmei in Indonesia",Off Campus Location,['2016-10-07 12:00'],"['Chinese studies', 'Colloquium', 'Film', 'Food', 'Free', 'Lecture', 'Research', 'Talk']"

36701,Nam Center Colloquium Series | You are What You Eat: The Practice of Obtaining and Maintaining Nationalist Identity,"Co-sponsored by the Department of Political Science and Political Scientists of Color (PSOC). What does it mean to treat nationalism as if it were a commodity that can be consumed and (re-)produced on the marketplace? This presentation starts with a short yet instructive tale of Monosodium Glutamate or MSG: despite the discovery of the substance by a Japanese chemist in 1908, it was actually the commodification of Chinese nationalism through MSG by patriotic capitalists in China that, to this day, makes the average consumer associate the flavor enhancer with China rather than Japan. This sets the stage for not only introducing the idea of consuming (and producing) identity, but also what it means to conceive of nationalism as a practice or a sustained process rather than a singular emotion or feeling. By introducing some of the commodification activities surrounding the territorial disputes among countries in Northeast Asia—both in terms of consumables and non-consumables—this presentation will showcase the close connection between politics and economics, and also challenge some of the traditional assumptions behind nationalism. Jiun Bang is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Nam Center for Korean Studies at the University of Michigan. Her doctoral project examined the ‘business of nationalism’ and explained how the process of commodification undertaken by various actors within the nation-state influences bilateral inter-state tensions. From 2008 to 2010, she was an associate at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses (KIDA), a government-affiliated research institute in Seoul. During that time, she was the assistant editor of the Korean Journal of Defense Analysis. She received her PhD from the University of Southern California in 2016, an MA in Security Studies from Georgetown University, and a BA in International Relations from Ewha Womans University in Seoul, her hometown.",Map School of Social Work Building - Room 1636,['2017-04-05 16:00'],"['Asia', 'Business', 'Food']"

It traces the long history of curds in China, demonstrating that such foods were regarded as delicacies by the elite, and account for their sudden and belated disappearance from the modern Chinese diet. The talk then concludes by exploring the modern legacies of the Chinese fascination with curds.

Kosher reception to follow. About the talk: Beginning in the 1920s, as Northeastern elite private universities began imposing quotas on the percentage of Jewish students on campus, the University of Michigan became an attractive destination for children of East Coast immigrant families. The University has long pointed to the presence of Jewish students during this period as evidence of its historic commitment to inclusion and diversity. Efforts by American universities to limit the number of Jews on campus in the early and mid-twentieth century was an important factor in shaping American university admissions policies and education. Understanding how and whether the University of Michigan participated in these exclusionary developments is critical to the history of the University. Professor Goldman discusses evidence drawn from University admissions practices and the religious profile of University of Michigan students in the 1920s and 30s to explore the ways in which the University both welcomed and limited the presence of Jewish students in this period. Given the intense focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion in this bicentennial year of the University of Michigan, a better understanding of the University’s historical approach to inclusion and diversity is particularly timely. We suggest you arrive early or stay late to see the related exhibit, Striving to Stimulate Serious Thought: Jewish Scholarly and Cultural Life at Michigan Across Two Centuries on display in the Special Collections space on the 7th floor of the Hatcher Graduate Library South.

She is also a member of Detroit’s Council of Elders. Ms. Moore educates her community on school district policy, student rights, and other education-related legal issues and parental involvement efforts. She earned a bachelor's degree from Wayne State University and a juris doctorate from the Detroit College of Law. BERNA RAVITZ My passion for education began bubbling within me long before I could articulate it. As a youngster I was decidedly unchallenged by school. Ironically that led me to acquire a Bachelor’s in Psychology, a Master’s in Education, certification in Bilingual Education, and finally, a Doctorate in Curriculum and Instruction. All of this was in pursuit of the magic formula for 'evening the playing field' for all of my students. I began utilizing gifted and talented strategies (constructivist education) and saw amazing results in the progress of our students. My Experience as Michigan Teacher of the Year, National Distinguished Principal as well as an Educational Fulbright exchange allowed me such incredible experiences that are invaluable in my work even today. Upon retirement from my being a principal, I worked for several years as an Educational Coach in Detroit Public Schools; I currently dedicate my time towards fulfilling the mission of Simply Start Kids.
