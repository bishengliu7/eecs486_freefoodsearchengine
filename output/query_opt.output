38166,Conference: Standing with Spain: Anti-Fascist Student Activism and the Spanish Civil War,"From 1936 to 1939, large numbers of U-M students mobilized to support the Spanish Republic as it fought a military uprising backed by Hitler and Mussolini. They joined an international movement that sought to make Spain the â€œtomb of fascism.â€ù In the Michigan Daily, news of the Spanish war unfolded on the front pages, and debates erupted in the op-ed section. The Student Senate passed a resolution urging the U.S. government to lift the embargo on selling arms to Spain. Students formed an aid committee, held rallies, and raised funds to send an ambulance to Spain. Three students volunteered for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and fought in Spain, one of whom would never return. In this conference students will present their original research on anti-fascist student activism at U-M. All events are free and open to the public.

Connect with our community of academics, students, staff, and leaders at our receptions that immediately follow each session. HOSTED BY: Jane Dutton, the Robert L. Kahn Distinguished University Professor of Business Administration and Psychology at Michigan Ross. SESSION DESCRIPTION: Most people want to work in a positive organization. Yet turning an organization positive is a most difficult challenge. Relationships, teams, organizations and communities are governed by conventional cultures that naturally resist positive change. In this presentation Bob will draw tools from his new book, The Positive Organization. The audience will have the opportunity to use the tools in real time, and create their own practical paths to positive organizing. ROBERT E. QUINN holds the Margaret Elliot Tracey Collegiate Professorship at the University of Michigan and serves on the faculty of Organization and Management at Michigan Ross. He is one of the co-founders of the Center for Positive Organizations. Quinnâ€™s research and teaching focus on leadership, organizational change and effectiveness. He has published 18 books on these subjects. His best-selling book, Deep Change has sold over 100,000 copies. His book, The Best Teacher in You won the Ben Franklin Award designating it the best book in education for 2015. His latest book is The Positive Organization: Breaking Free of Conventional Cultures, Constraints and Beliefs. He is particularly known for his work on the competing values framework. It has been used by organizations across the globe and thousands of managers have been trained in the use of the Framework. He has thirty-five years of experience consulting with major corporations and government agencies. He is a fellow of the Academy of Management and the World Business Academy. You can read more about Bob on his website at www.bob-quinn.com. Positive Links sessions take place at Michigan Ross, and are free and open to the public. Most sessions are live-streamed via a link from our Events page, and then a listing is added to our Videos page post-session. For more information, visit poslinksseries.com.
