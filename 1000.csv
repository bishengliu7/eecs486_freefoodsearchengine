28194,CSAS Lecture Series,"Speaker: Stewart Gordon Dr. Gordon will reflect on his three recent books on World History (When Asia was the World, History of the World in Sixteen Shipwrecks, and Shackles of Iron: Slavery Beyond the Atlantic World). Eight months in India on a Fulbright last year brought into perspective not just the intense politics of history and culture at this juncture but also the very real limitations of his own research on India, based as it is on scribal documents. In many public lectures he connected India with the larger physical and intellectual world, exploring themes of gender, environment, science and systems of honor. He will discuss what he saw and heard and what it might mean for the field of South Asian Studies. Stewart Gordon is an Independent Scholar long associated with the Center for South Asian Studies at the University of Michigan. He has rambled by bus across Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, struggled up Inca paths in Peru and boated up the Mekong and the Mississippi. Gordon has photographed antiquities in Cambodia and Paleolithic cave paintings in India and has served as a consultant for the History Channel, the Discovery Channel, the Walt Disney Company and the American Queen steamboat. He writes regularly for Aramco World magazine. Gordon has received many awards including Woodrow Wilson and Fulbright fellowships and an Earhart Foundation writing grant. His scholarly output includes more than two dozen articles and four books on Indian history, all based on archival work. His “When Asia was the World”, became a bestseller and has been translated into seven languages.

In partnership with the Jim Toy Community Center, the artists have given their time and talent to raise critically needed funds for the DeBoer-Rowse Family to legally co-adopt their three children. A benefit for the Michigan Marriage Challenge, presented by the Jim Toy Community Center will be held on Sunday, February 23, 2014 at 1pm at The ARK, 316 S. Main, Ann Arbor, MI, 734-761-1800. Tickets: $250 Benefactor - reserved seating house floor front & center, $100 Supporters - reserved seating house center and $25 General Admission. All of the artists and the attorneys are donating their time to help raise critically needed funds. This benefit is an opportunity for supporters of marriage equality to help make it a reality. Emceed by U of M Professor Holly Hughes, the evening will feature artists such as singer songwriter Vienna Teng (viennateng.com/), folk duo Nervous But Excited in a greatly anticipated re-union (nervousbutexcited.com), the Dueling Divas Callie McKee and Robby Griswold of Arbor Opera Theatre, and many others. Help the DeBoer-Rowse Family: Hazel Park lesbian couple April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse are suing the state of Michigan for the right to legally wed and thereby co-adopt their three kids. Their case represents a direct, effective and rapid means of securing marriage equality in Michigan. The state licensed the two nurses as a couple to serve as foster parents of their three special needs children, but Michigan law allows only legally married couples to jointly adopt children. This civil right, afforded all others in Michigan, is not available to the DeBoer-Rowse family due to Michigan’s constitutional ban on the state recognizing marriages of same-gender couples. Because they are prohibited by law to adopt jointly, Rowse adopted their two sons, and DeBoer their daughter. The law firm Nessel and Kessel is arguing the DeBoer-Rowse family’s case pro bono; however, bringing in expert witnesses to demonstrate to the court that same-gender couples are fit parents is expensive. The lawyers estimate the witnesses and other legal expenses could cost a combined quarter of a million dollars at a minimum. Federal Judge Bernard A. Friedman, of the Eastern District of Michigan, will begin hearing evidence in DeBoer v. Snyder in late February.","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.

18808,EEB Thursday Seminar Series,"The formal discussion of how animals appear to be designed to function in their environment started over 200 years ago when William Paley described how animals were adapted to their environment by an omnipotent designer. The modern environment that wild animals face is changing dramatically due to human activities. Over 50 years ago, Richard Levins described adaptive phenotypic plasticity as an evolutionary strategy that animals could use to adapt to such changing environments. My research focuses on understanding the evolutionary strategies and physiological mechanisms by which real animals in real places adapt to changing environments. In this seminar, I provide an overview of my past, current, and future research in wild animals. I show that wild red squirrels live in an environment where natural selection on offspring phenotype fluctuates across years but that maternal stress responses to cues of density-mediated selection cause adaptive developmental plasticity in offspring phenotype that allows them to cope with this variable environment. Secondly, I show how the hormonal mediation of broad patterns of variation in mammalian life histories may mediate but also constrain adaptive life history plasticity to a changing environment. Third, I show how individual variation and plasticity in pro-social (cooperative) behavior in free-living meerkats may be caused by individual differences in stress physiology such that some individuals are constrained to exhibit either a high or low level of pro-social behavior regardless of changes in their social environment. Overall, these three examples of my research highlight how studying questions at the interface of ecology, evolution, and physiology can lead to new insights into the role of phenotypic plasticity in facilitating and constraining contemporary adaptation to altered environments.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1210,['2014-10-02 16:00'],['Ecology & biology'],F

15897,WCED Lecture,"Baktybek Beshimov, visiting professor, Northeastern University; visiting scholar, Center for International Studies, MIT This lecture will focus on the intriguing relationship of the weak states of Central Asia with great powers. Dr. Beshimov will describe what goals the local ruling elites pursue in their relationship with the U.S., Russia, and China; what tactics they use to manipulate the interests of these superpowers; and how this interplay of strategies and tactics impacts state building processes in the region. He will discuss how the concepts of “state weakness” and “strength” in the context of the complex geopolitical environment in the region take on unexpected forms and bear new meanings. Dr. Baktybek Beshimov is a visiting professor at Northeastern University and visiting scholar at the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He combines extensive experience in politics, education, diplomacy, and development. In politics, Dr. Beshimov was twice elected to the parliament of Kyrgyzstan, where he served as leader of the opposition fraction and parliament representative to the OSCE. In education, he served as provost/vice president for academic affairs of the American University in Central Asia and president of Osh State University. At both schools he promoted liberal arts education–an educational system very novel in that region to this day. In diplomacy, Dr. Beshimov served as Ambassador of Kyrgyzstan to India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh. In development, he played a key role in formulating development policy in Kyrgyzstan as national manager of the United Nations Ferghana Valley Development Program and of the UNDP LIFE program in the 1990s. In 2010 the National Endowment for Democracy awarded Dr. Beshimov the prestigious Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellowship. Also in 2010, he was a visiting scholar at Harvard University’s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies. In 2011-2013, he was a visiting professor of government at Suffolk University. Dr. Beshimov is co-author of the books Ferghana Valley: The Heart of Central Asia, Civic Movements in Kyrgyzstan, and Interethnic Relations: Practice and Problems. He is a frequent contributor to international and regional media, and his articles have been published in the Wall Street Journal, Transitions Online, and other publications. Part of the series Pluralism in Politics and Culture, a new initiative jointly sponsored by CREES and WCED that examines the foundations of free and open societies. The project builds on the university’s rich legacy of study and support of the dissident culture in the former Soviet Union and on several existing efforts at U-M.

37560,"ARCHIGRAM OPENING LECTURE: DENNIS CROMPTON, ""SEARCHING FOR A RESPONSIVE ENVIRONMENT""","Born in Blackpool in 1935, Dennis Crompton became a member of the architect-collaborative group Archigram, which was established in London in 1961. Archigram operated as an experimental think-tank. The practice produced a multitude of products that represented a shift in how architectural practice is considered including a magazine, projects, models, exhibitions and proposals. This shift in architectural practice focused on prioritizing processes and responsive structures for living. Influenced by popular culture and responding to the proliferation of technological advances at the time, as well as recognizing the increasing social and political discontent, Archigram’s production emphasized mobility and flexibility in ways that continue to have currency today. At Archigram, Crompton was an enthusiast of gadgets, machines, techniques and systems, and invented the provocative “things that go bang in the night” projects. He orchestrated the Archigram Archives in 1975 when the practice ended. With Ron Herron, Crompton was responsible for the assembly and design of the major exhibition “Archigram: Experimental Architecture 1961-74,” which opened in Vienna in 1994. He shepherded the Archigram Exhibition around Europe, Asia and North America. Archigram was awarded the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture by the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2002. Outside of Archigram, Crompton had a strong involvement with the Architectural Association School since 1965 where he taught for over thirty years. More recently, he taught masters courses in Architecture and Urban Design at The Bartlett School of Architecture and frequently lectures in the U.S. and Europe. Exhibition opening reception for Crompton's exhibition, ""Archigram,"" will immediately follow at the Liberty Research Annex (305 W.

21387,Depression on College Campuses Conference,"Recent research indicates that more than half of college students report “above average” or “tremendous” stress levels, and 30 percent say that stress has a negative impact on their academic performance. While there will always be some level of stress, competition, and pressure in a college student’s life, must success always be equated with stress? And ultimately, is it possible for a university to promote a culture of academic rigor and excellence, while simultaneously encouraging positive student mental health? Join us for the 13th Annual Depression on College Campuses Conference to explore these questions, and learn about new research findings and model programs which demonstrate how a focus on managing the climate of stress on campus – and helping students to cope more effectively with the inevitable bouts of stress that will occur – can improve overall student wellness and allow students to achieve their full potential. The conference will feature a choice of intensive three-hour workshops in addition to keynote presentations, panel discussions, and concurrent sessions. Online registration is now open. Applications have been made to provide Continuing Education credits for social workers and certified counselors. Please check back in early January for confirmation of the number of credit that will be provided. Registration is FREE for all students from any campus. Registration fee for non-students is $135 before February 6th, and $150 after February 6th.

27042,Developmental Area Brown Bag - Speech segmentation in typically developing children and children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: an MEG study/Trajectories of Smoking Over the Transition to Retirement,".ABSTRACT: Speech segmentation, or identifying syllables and words in a continuous linguistic stream, is foundational for language acquisition. Yet, surprisingly little is known about the neural mechanisms that support children’s ability to identify syllabic units in a continuous linguistic stream and how these mechanisms might be affected by neurodevelopmental impairments in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Although ASD is characterized by delays in language acquisition, it is generally unknown what learning mechanisms lead to impaired language in ASD. Typically developing children are able to utilize regularities in speech (e.g. transitional probabilities, TP) in order to detect various aspects of phonotactics and syntactic rules. However, it is not established whether children with ASD can also take advantage of statistical regularities in naturally spoken language. The present study investigated the neuro-cognitive mechanism of speech segmentation by comparing typically developing children to children with ASD using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) neuroimaging during a language-based statistical learning paradigm. We investigated learning ability and concurrent brain activation while 15 ASD children and 14 healthy controls (ages 8-12) listened to three repetitions of a 2-minute passage in a new language (Italian). Italian passages included target words with high (TP = 1.0; HTP) and low (TP = 0.33; LTP) internal predictability between syllables. Behavioral testing at the end of the session revealed that typically developing children outperformed children with ASD on both the HTP (t(24) = 3.00, p < 0.01) and LTP (t(26) = 4.39, p < 0.001) target words. MEG measures of event related brain responses indicate learning differences between the groups in the left primary auditory cortex, left superior temporal gyrus, and the left inferior frontal gyrus. Interestingly, learning performance across the groups appeared to be a better predictor of brain response to target words than did the developmental profile of the children. Our findings contribute new insights to better understanding the developing brain and provide implications for language and communication impairments observed in ASD. BIO: Neelima is a third year PhD candidate in the Developmental program. She graduated from Michigan State University in 2013 with a B.S. in Psychology and a specialization in Cognitive Science. In general, her area of research examines the underlying brain mechanisms that support language acquisition in infants and children, and the various trajectories of language development over the course of the human lifespan (e.g. bilingualism, language impairments). Her focus is on the use of multimodal neuroimaging techniques and methodologies applied to developmental populations. Today, she will be presenting on her 619 project. ABSTRACT: Retirement is an important life transition that may motivate older adults to make significant changes to their health behaviors, such as quitting smoking. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative study of US adults over age 50, to examine the different trajectories of smoking over the transition to retirement. We then determine the role of a recent hospitalization in differentiating between individuals who continue to smoke from those who quit during the retirement transition. Using a group-based trajectory approach, we identified five distinct trajectories of smoking over the transition to retirement. Our results suggest that hospitalizations that occur close to retirement may be interpreted differently from those that occur during the working years and may be more likely to promote health behavior change. In conclusion, there is no single trajectory that characterizes the influence of retirement on smoking behavior. Healthcare professionals should consider increasing the salience of upcoming life transitions like retirement when counseling older adults on smoking cessation. BIO: Jennifer Sun is a joint MD/PhD student at the University of Michigan who is currently pursuing her PhD in Developmental Psychology. Her advisors are Dr. Jacqui Smith and Dr. Toni Antonucci, and her research interests revolve around how psychosocial factors affect chronic disease outcomes and healthcare utilization among older adults. She hopes to pursue a career in primary care and incorporate more behavioral interventions into clinical practice.

In this daylong mix of presentations, panels, and conversations, we’ll discuss how to disentangle luck from skill. We’ll explore whether today’s successful individuals and organizations are truly great or have they serendipitously lit upon strategies or actions that provide temporary advantages. We’ll also consider the extent to which the contributions of skill and luck vary across domains. Are, for example, golfers more dependent on luck than tennis players? Are investment bankers more dependent on skill than venture capitalists? We’ll also touch on streaks. Fifty-six games in a row cannot be luck. Or can it? And, finally, we’ll try to unpack the effects of the increasing complexity and rates of change in the economic, political, social, and even biological worlds on the returns to skill.

His accordion and vocals defined this new style of Creole music, incorporating the soulful sounds of R&B into contemporary zydeco music and dance. But he's also the son of famed accordionist Delton Broussard, and he began his musical journey on the drums in his father's legendary band, the Lawtell Playboys, who were themselves innovators. During this time, Jeffery was exposed to some of the great Creole fiddle players, including the king of the zydeco fiddle, Calvin Carrière. Jeffery has retained the precious melodies and songs he heard at home, at social gathering,s and on the bandstand. With the creation of the Creole Cowboys, and with a mean Creole fiddle added to his arsenal, he captures the essence of Louisiana's rich musical heritage.

His initial work addressed aspects of plate tectonics. Following a 2-year post-doc at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and 4 months as an exchange scientist in the USSR studying earthquake prediction, he began an assistant professorship at MIT, where he turned his attention to the processes by which continents deform on a large scale and in particular how mountain ranges form. After 12 years of being dissatisfied with his teaching, he quit and returned to the life of a post-doc. In 2000, eager to change the direction of his research to include the study of how large-scale geodynamic processes have affected climate on geologic time scales, he moved to the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Colorado and became a fellow in the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES). Peter Molnar’s research focuses largely on these two questions: (1) how large-scale geodynamics cause deformation of the Earth’s crust, including earthquakes and the building of mountain ranges, and (2) how shifting continents, emergence of islands, growth of mountains, etc. affect climate on geologic time scales. His work has included fieldwork in remote parts of the world, and numerical calculations of processes that obey rules of fluid mechanics, but he is incompetent, and unwelcome, in a laboratory. He teaches a graduate seminar in “Tectonics and Climate,” among other courses.",Map School of Social Work Building - 1636,['2016-03-11 16:00'],['Lecture'],F

16907,"Todd Cronan Lecture, ""The Medium Has No Message: The (Non)Politics of Medium from Kandinsky to Benjamin""","Does the medium have a message? Is there a deep connection between media and subjectivity? Does the ubiquity of images that seemingly defines modernity constitute or transform our consciousness? Do the media that we use shape or even determine our politics? For a wide range of modernists and (for most) postmodernists the connection is assumed, a given. Looking at a foundational moment of media theory–the moment of Kandinsky’s first abstractions to Benjamin’s theory of mechanical reproduction–I show how a growing pessimism about human agency finds its resolution in a utopian optimism about technology’s effects (even or especially when that technology is the object of critique). I will show what is mistaken about correlating media and subjectivity. I will also suggest how this now canonized mistake can and should be replaced with something better. Todd Cronan is Assistant Professor of art history at Emory University, where his research centers on twentieth-century art and art theory with particular emphasis on problems around expression, intention, affect, form and meaning. He is the author of Against Affective Formalism: Matisse, Bergson, Modernism (Univ. of Minnesota Press, 2013) and Matisse (Phaidon, 2014). His articles have appeared in the New German Critique, British Journal of the History of Philosophy, Design and Culture, Zetischrift fur Kunstgeschichte, qui parle and nonsite.org and he serves on the editorial board of nonsite.org. His current book project, Seeing Photographically, looks at photographic debates about the ontology of the medium and how those ideas shaped both photographic and painterly practice in the first half of the 20th c.",Map Tappan Hall - 180,['2014-03-21 16:00'],['Visual arts'],F
28565,Transduction and Medial Conversion: Line—Letter—Trace,"In the spring of 2008, the First Sounds Initiative made international headlines by releasing digitally recovered audio from a recording dated April 9, 1860, seventeen years before Thomas Edison invented his phonograph. The haunting vocal rendition of “Au Clair de la Lune” had been recorded by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville on the phonautograph, an instrument he had designed to trace airborne sound vibrations onto soot-blackened sheets of paper using an artificial eardrum. His goal in transducing sounds was to convert them into graphical texts people would access just as they did other “writings”: namely, by exposing them to light and looking at them. By playing back Scott’s phonautograms as sound, we arguably subverted his original intentions, but at the same time we made it possible for listeners to experience his work in a newly enlightening and enchanting way. Drawing on this and other recent cases of media being “played” against the grain, I’ll explore how novel approaches to the history and practice of transduction can challenge received wisdom about what counts as historical audio and video. Patrick Feaster is a specialist in the history, culture, and preservation of early time-based media. A three-time Grammy nominee, co-founder of the First Sounds Initiative, and current President of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections, he has been actively involved in locating, identifying, and contextualizing many of the world's oldest sound recordings and has pioneered a number of digital processing strategies for bringing historical sources to life as audio, video, and 3D imagery. He is the author of Pictures of Sound: One Thousand Years of Educed Audio, 980-1980, as well as various album notes and articles about the history and theory of phonography. He received his doctorate in Folklore and Ethnomusicology in 2007 from Indiana University Bloomington, where he is now Media Preservation Specialist for the Media Digitization and Preservation Initiative.","Map 202 S.

Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, Betty Ford Classroom (1110), Weill Hall 735 S. State Street, Ann Arbor 48109-3091 Sponsored by: Center for Local, State, and Urban Policy (CLOSUP) Co-Sponsors: Energy Institute; LSA Political Science; Climate Center; University of Michigan Program in the Environment (PitE) Description: How do Americans think about energy? Is the debate over fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable energy highly partisan and ideological? Are people’s preferences for different energy sources idiosyncratic, or is there a common pattern that explains how people view energy across sources? How much does concern about climate change weigh on these opinions? David Konisky answers these questions and more in a discussion of his 2014 book, Cheap and Clean. About the speaker: David Konisky is Associate Professor of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. Konisky’s research focuses on American politics and public policy, with particular emphasis on regulation, environmental politics and policy, state politics, and public opinion. His research has been published in leading political science and public policy journals, and he has the authored or edited three books, including most recently, Failed Promises: Evaluating the Federal Government's Response to Environmental Justice (MIT Press, 2015). Konisky earned his Ph.D. in political science at MIT, and has master’s degrees in environmental management and international relations from Yale University and a bachelor’s degree in history and environmental studies from Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to joining the faculty at Indiana University, he served on the faculty at Georgetown University.

Why do tax-paying, prison-funding citizens rarely get the chance to see such images? And what roles do these pictures play for those within the system? With stark aesthetic detail and meticulous documentation, Prison Obscura builds the case that Americans must come face to face with these images and imaging technologies both to grasp the cancerous proliferation of the U.S. prison system and to connect with those it confines.

33500,"Social, Behavioral, and Experimental Economics (SBEE)","Abstract: We study markets for sensitive personal information. An agent wants to communicate with another party but any revealed information can be intercepted and sold to a third party whose reaction harms the agent. The market for information induces an adverse sorting effect, allocating the information to those types of third parties who harm the agent most. In equilibrium, this limits information transmission by the agent, but never fully deters it. We also consider agents who naively provide information to the market. Their presence renders traded information more valuable and, thus, harms sophisticated agents by increasing the third party’s demand for information. Half-baked regulatory interventions may hurt naive agents without helping sophisticated agents.

Steve himself has recorded for Mercury and for his own 98 Pounder label, the name referring to his high-school wrestling weight. Over the course of his life he’s met Elvis Presley (who hugged his sister for far too long), trick-or-treated at Liberace’s house (each finger had a diamond ring), was Bob Hope’s favorite altar boy (according to him), and bravely traveled the world busking before he knew how to do it, His eclectic songbag is an unpredictable mixture of comic and serious, sometimes within the same song, and his stage show is a wonderfully unpredictable freeform mix of elements.

5638,Sustainability in Public Policy,"Complaining about government waste is almost a cliché. At the very least, sustainability does not seem to be on their checklist of mandatory considerations before making most decisions. Everything from policy to the execution of initiatives often misses the mark on the dire need to transition our society to one that is in alignment with nature, rather than at odds with it. What, if any, national government strategy exists to encourage social progress that meets the needs of everyone, effective protection of the environment, and prudent use of natural resources, while maintaining high and stable levels of economic growth and employment? Added to these ongoing issues is the unrest in the Middle East and its impact on the price of energy. These are questions to be explored with a panel of U-M faculty, alumni experts and government insiders.","Off Campus Location - School for International Service, American University, 4400 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016",['2011-04-07 18:30'],['Environmental'],F

12863,Civic Engagement and Performance Management,"Abstract “The legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do, for themselves in their separate and individual capacities.” - Abraham Lincoln Government exists to produce positive outcomes in the community and those outcomes are “co-produced” by government and citizens working together. Every citizen has political responsibilities since improvements in government performance only occur as the result of a series of political acts. In the 21st Century, performance management means partnering with citizens to produce results. Nothing else works. We’ll address some of the aspects of this co-production and how it is working across America, including community economic development, place making and the tools and techniques of deliberative democracy. Dr. Mark Funkhouser is the Director of the Governing Institute. Prior to that, he was mayor of Kansas City, Missouri from 2007 to 2011. Funkhouser was the first government professional ever elected by Kansas Citizens to serve as their mayor. During his controversial term he relied heavily on his experience and training in public finance to lead the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. When he left office, the city’s finances were in the best shape they had been in over a decade, a feat accomplished in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression. Funkhouser began his career as a guard at George Junior Republic, a youth corrections facility in Grove City, Pennsylvania. He went on to work as a rehabilitation counselor with the Pennsylvania State Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation and then as an assistant professor at Salem College in Salem, West Virginia, teaching social work and sociology. In 1978 he began a career as a performance auditor, first in Tennessee state government and then for the City of Kansas City, where he served as City Auditor from 1988 until 2006. Under his leadership, the City Auditor’s Office won the Knighton Award for outstanding auditing in 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2004. GOVERNING recognized Funkhouser as one of its Public Officials of the Year in 2003. While he was the City Auditor, Funkhouser also taught courses in public budgeting, program evaluation, policy analysis, public finance and related topics in the MPA programs of the University of Kansas and the University of Missouri at Kansas City. He has written extensively about government performance and accountability and spoken at numerous seminars and workshops throughout the world. His book, Honest, Competent Government, was the first global study of performance auditing. In addition, he has served on the editorial boards of several publications including the American Review of Public Administration and the Journal of Government Financial Management. Funkhouser’s academic training includes a bachelor’s degree in political science from Thiel College, a master’s degree in social work from West Virginia University, an MBA in accounting and finance from Tennessee State University, and an interdisciplinary PhD in public administration and sociology from the University of Missouri at Kansas City.

35464,Screening/Q&A: Composed,"Through the lens of professional classical musicians, Composed explores the many ways we experience and can address performance anxiety. Faced with the judgment of peers, audience, conductors, and worst of all themselves, these musicians spend years trying to understand and overcome the physical and mental manifestations of their anxiety. Through their stories, we learn valuable lessons learned over a lifetime of professional performance; and we find that we are not alone in our quest to overcome the fear of failure and embarrassment. For anyone wanting to feel strength over fear and compassion over judgment, or simply seeking a closer look at anxiety and what makes us tick, Composed opens the door to a world of high stakes, high pressure, and peak performing. Following the screening a Q&A will be held with the film’s director John Beder, Julie Nagel (psychoanalyst, psychologist, pianist, and author of ""Melodies of the Mind""), Louis Nagel (pianist and Emeritus Professor of Piano and Piano Literature), and Emily Hyssong (CAPS Counsellor).",Map Earl V.

29781,John Dinkeloo Memorial Lecture: David Adjaye,"The University of Michigan's Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning presents...the John Dinkeloo Memorial Lecture by David Adjaye. David Adjaye OBE is recognized as a leading architect of his generation. Adjaye was born in Tanzania to Ghanaian parents and his influences range from contemporary art, music and science to African art forms and the civic life of cities. In 1994 he set up his first office, where his ingenious use of materials and his sculptural ability established him as an architect with an artist’s sensibility and vision. He reformed his studio as Adjaye Associates in 2000 and immediately won several prestigious commissions. In Oslo he designed the Nobel Peace Centre in the shell of a disused railway station (completed in 2005). In London his design for the Whitechapel Idea Store pioneered a new approach to the provision of information services (2005). Later projects in London included the Stephen Lawrence Centre, with teaching and community spaces (2007), Rivington Place, an exhibition venue and resource centre (2007), and the Bernie Grant Centre for the performing arts (2007). Adjaye Associates’ largest completed project to date is the £160 million Moscow School of Management Skolkovo (2010). Adjaye Associates now has four international offices, with projects throughout the world. These include a shopping and cultural complex in Beirut (ongoing), a concept store in Lagos (2014), a new headquarters building for the International Finance Corporation in Dakar (ongoing) and a hospital in Rwanda (ongoing). Adjaye frequently collaborates with contemporary artists on art and installation projects. Examples include The Upper Room, with thirteen paintings by Chris Ofili (2002), Within Reach, a second installation with Ofili in the British pavilion at the Venice Biennale (2003), and the Thyssen-Bornemisza Art for the 21st Century Pavilion that was designed to show a projection work by Olafur Eliasson, Your Black Horizon, at the 2005 Venice Biennale. The Upper Room is now in the permanent collection of Tate Britain. Adjaye is now collaborating with Okwui Enwezor on the design of the forthcoming 56th Venice Art Biennale. Adjaye has taught at the Royal College of Art, where he had previously studied, and at the Architectural Association School in London, and has held distinguished professorships at the universities of Pennsylvania, Yale and Princeton. He is currently the John C. Portman Design Critic in Architecture at Harvard. He was awarded the OBE for services to architecture in 2007, received the Design Miami/ Year of the Artist title in 2011, the Wall Street Journal Innovator Award in 2013 and the W.E.B. Du Bois medal from Harvard University. The material from Adjaye’s ten-year study of the capital cities of Africa was shown in Urban Africa, an exhibition at the Design Museum, London (2010) and published as African Metropolitan Architecture (New York, 2011, and as Adjaye Africa Architecture, London, 2011). He was the artistic director of GEO-graphics: A map of art practices in Africa, past and present, a major exhibition at the Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels (2010). The last exhibition of his architectural work, David Adjaye: Output, was held at Gallery MA, Tokyo (2010) and he is now collaborating with Haus der Kunst in Munich and the Art Institute of Chicago on a comprehensive retrospective exhibition, which will open in 2015. The John Dinkeloo Memorial Lecture was established to recognize John Dinkeloo's extraordinary contributions to architecture, to honor his distinguished professional work and to pay tribute to this highly respected alumnus of the Architecture Program at the University of Michigan. About University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning: The Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of Michigan is a leader in interdisciplinary education and research with a focus on creating a more beautiful, inclusive and better built environment.

Ever since they started singing together on the street corners, farmers' markets, and subway stations of New York City, strangers and neighbors come to rejoice in the sound, and there is no divide between performer and spectator. Paste describes their sound this way: ""Dusty acoustic guitars, wailing fiddles and weeping accordions, with a woozy-yet-skintight rhythm section-- and topped off with burr-edged vocals that sound like they've been soaked in a Mason jar for generations–it's the type of music that blurs the line between past and present so thoroughly, and so deftly, that time feels irrelevant."" Hurray for the Riff Raff is Alynda lee Segarra, a 25 year old Puerto Rican from the Bronx. After leaving home at an early age to travel the country, she eventually settled in New Orleans where she began to perform and record with a revolving cast of musicians. Alynda and her longtime gunslinger on fiddle, Yosi Perlstein, met up with a young honky-tonk band called the Tumbleweeds, just as Alynda began to expand her musical palette to include country, rock 'n' roll, pop, and soul. In the tradition of Bob Dylan with Band and Neil Young with Crazy Horse, Alynda and Yosi recruited the Tumbleweeds to be their touring band, drastically altering the sound of Hurray for the Riff Raff. From the swamp pop of “Little Black Star” to the classic country of “Look Out Mama,” to the psychedelia of “Ode to John and Yoko” and even the surf rock of “Lake of Fire,"" Hurray for the Riff Raff covers a wide array of musical ground, with every song unified by Alynda’s soulful vocals and expert songwriting.

3584,EEB Thursday Seminar Series,"Abstract: Meiotic recombination has long been recognized as a driving force of evolution. However, little is known about the evolution of meiosis. To fill this gap, we take a variety of approaches to investigate how meiotic processes evolve in plants. Among others, we cloned the ameiotic 1 gene in maize, which is responsible for the switch from mitotic cell division to meiosis in maize, and found that the mechanism of meiosis initiation differs not only between fungi, mammals, and plants but also between monocot and dicot plants. We also studied sequence variation in several meiotic recombination genes in maize and its wild ancestor teosinte and discovered that a large fraction of these genes were targets of positive selection during maize domestication and subsequent breeding. These results suggest that even though meiosis is an ancient and conserved process some meiotic genes show rapid evolution.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1210,['2010-09-16 16:00'],[],F

38470,"HEP-Astro Seminar | Probing QCD Matter at Extremely High Temperatures in ATLAS: Jet Measurements in p+p, p+Pb and Pb+Pb Collisions at 5 TeV",Collisions between two lead nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider produce extremely high temperature QCD matter which is best described as consisting of deconfined quarks and gluons. A powerful tool to understand this matter is to use the high momentum quarks and gluons generated in hard scattering processes in the earliest stages of the nuclear collision as probes of the matter at later times. These measurements use modifications to the jet rates and properties induced by the scattering of the probes off the constituents of the matter to infer the nature of the interactions and constrain the properties of the matter. This talk will describe the new measurements at 5 TeV collision energy of jets and their properties in the ATLAS detector in lead-lead collisions as well proton-proton and proton-lead collisions which provide a baseline for the lead-lead measurements.,Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-06 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']",F

We use the stochastic Perron's method and characterize the finite dimensional approximation as a viscosity solution to the corresponding HJB equation. It turns out that this solution is the concave envelope of the cost function with respect to the atoms of the terminal law. We demonstrate the results by finding explicit solutions for a class of cost functions. Joint work with Erhan Bayraktar (UM) and Alex Cox (Bath).

In May 2015, Sally Bjork, photographer at the U-M Department of the History of Art’s Visual Resources Collections, took part in a 16-day tour through major cities and regions of Iran. Her charge was to photograph sites, monuments, artwork, and urban and rural environments that could be used for research and teaching amongst numerous disciplines. The result - some 8,000 images that celebrate life, vibrancy, and color, as well as Iranian traditions of art and design through the centuries. Bjork selected various images from this extensive collection to create “This, too, is Iran,” broadening the perspective of Iran for an American audience.

4068,Edge compartmental infectious disease models,"The structure of social interactions along which disease spreads can be represented using a network. When we investigate disease spreading in a network we find that many of the assumptions of mass action mixing fail. Individuals with many contacts tend to become infected earlier, and in turn infect more individuals, leading to faster initial growth. However, the remaining population has fewer contacts than average, and so the growth rate decreases more rapidly and the epidemic eventually dies out sooner than mass action predicts. Unfortunately mathematical models of infectious disease tend to require (arbitrarily) many differential equations. Recent work by Erik Volz (SIR dynamics in random networks with heterogeneous connectivity, JMB 2008) showed that it is possible to capture the dynamics exactly with a low-dimensional system. My own work (A note on a paper by Erik Volz: SIR dynamics in random networks, JMB 2010) has shown that it is possible to simplify this derivation and in so doing arrive at an even simpler system. Our more recent unpublished work simplifies the derivation further, and allows easy generalization to a wide range of (SI or SIR) diseases and population structures, including populations whose contacts change in time. The key simplification comes from focusing our attention to the fraction of edges that connect to susceptible, infected, or recovered individuals rather than the fraction of the population with given infection status. I will show how to derive these systems and compare the resulting predictions with simulation.",Map West Hall - 335,['2010-10-25 14:30'],[],F

18601,Sponsor Blood Drive,"To make an appointment to donate, please visit redcrossblood.org, sponsor code ""goblue"". BDU seeks to improve the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s blood donation eligibility criteria. Currently, men who have sex with men are banned for life from donating blood. We firmly believe this is a discriminatory and inadequate policy. With a holistic change to eligibility criteria, greater attention can be given to a greater number of risk factors and the safety of the blood supply could be improved. If these changes were implemented, it would also eliminate the existing social injustice against men who have sex with men.One way in which we are raising awareness of this policy is through sponsor drives, which are blood drives in which an ineligible donor brings someone who is eligible to donate on their behalf. When every presenting donor is accompanied by an ineligible individual, the potential to collect twice as many pints of blood is visually demonstrated. Rather than interfering with ongoing blood drives, this format is constructive and has the ultimate goal of saving as many lives as possible. With the support of many organizations and blood collection agencies throughout the United States, we hope to approach the FDA with our rationale for changing the health history questionnaire.",Michigan League,['2014-09-12 12:00'],[],F

These direct impacts of human activities on forests interact with other anthropogenic drivers such as climate variability to affect the capacity of forests to provide ecosystem services.

The project will feature a video installation in the IH gallery, an interactive portrait exhibition in GalleryDAAS, and a video screening of the award winning film, Chameleon Street. The screenings will be held at the Institute of the Humanities and at the Charles Wright Museum in Detroit, MI. About the project: The Crown: Shani Peters and Contemporary Construction of Self in America is a series of projects by artist Shani Peters that will examine the socially acceptable yet complicated concept of Black pride and success. Crowns, symbolic of kings and queens, and conferred on any number of Black popular culture figures from James Brown to Biggie, are also symbols for systems of inequitably distributed resources and injustice. This multi-part project—which includes two exhibitions, a film screening, and a panel discussion—asks the question: what does it mean to acknowledge the need for these forms of pride and success while recognizing their problems? It further complicates the question with a consideration of the similar celebration and pride that comes from attaining degrees of higher education which offer obvious opportunities, yet can alienate students of African descent from their origins. The artist asks, how do Black people register these complicated elements in ways that allow them to move progressively through western power structures towards futures that reflect their right to dignity and self-determination?

31189,Mira Henry: The View Inside,"Before joining the faculty of the Southern California Institute of Architecture in Los Angeles, Mira Henry spent several years as a project architect, immersed in the everyday, banal details of how buildings get built: construction drawings, material specs, and building codes. She became an expert in seeing the world the way an architect sees it. But as a progressive architectural thinker, Henry’s inspiration has been to deconstruct that vision, to “unsee” the very forms and representations that constitute an architect’s basic language. Through speculative experiments and conceptual drawings Henry discovers in static architectural details an unsettling range of figurative expression, including, for example, the way the profiles of roof eaves resemble human heads. Wallpaper, with its ability to mask, transform, or animate a space, is also a prominent element in her work.

Their dynamic and warm live performances mix the most touching old Irish songs with hard-hitting reels and jigs, and the band members' interest in and sheer enjoyment of each other musically is apparent even to audience members new to the Irish tradition. For the Irish music enthusiast, Altan has a treasure trove of brilliant moves to offer: the mix of sounds from Donegal with outside influences, the sheer virtuosity of the players, the beauty, delicate singing, and down-to-earth charm of singer and fiddler Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh. Anywhere they go, a concert by Altan is the Irish music event of the year.

Synopsis: GO FAR: THE CHRISTOPHER RUSH STORY chronicles the inspirational life of Christopher Rush, a quadriplegic and national MDA poster child, who lived with muscular dystrophy from birth to his death at age 30, well beyond his predicted two years of life. Chris achieved extraordinary goals despite impossible odds and left behind a philosophy of life for all of us to follow. GO FAR is a motivational film that will inspire not only persons with disabilities, but everyone, to follow their dreams and achieve them, no matter the obstacles. Featuring Tony Orlando, Jerry Lewis, and narrated by Mark Hamill.   Shortly before his death Chris invented a program called GO FAR, a motivational program that he intended to promote by traveling the world and inspiring those in need. This film's purpose is to be used as a tool to promote Chris’ message and continue his goal of promoting the GO FAR philosophy. Chris’ memoirs state “I think it’s true that we all serve a purpose in life and I’ve always accepted my own as being one of a messenger. It became my mission to teach others--that no matter the obstacles in front of them--they too can GO FAR.” This presentation is part of the U-M Services for Students with Disabilities 40th Anniversary.",Map Alumni Center,['2014-09-09 18:00'],"['Community service', 'Film', 'Health & wellness', 'Medicine', 'Ssd 40th anniversary']",F

Then, we will see how a dynamic programming principle can be proven for mean field type control problems. To do so, starting from a stochastic formulation we rewrite such problems as the optimal control of a McKean-Vlasov equation. We can also clarify a link with the calculus of variations for these problems. Last, a fixed point algorithm will be presented together with numerical results.

For all his rapid-fire playing, though, Adrian never loses sight of melodies and their power to move us. And on top of that, he's a tall tale teller of the first order, with a dry sense of humor that would be reason enough in itself to come to one of his concerts. Says Newsday: ""Unlike Richard Thompson or Robert Fripp, in whose league he belongs, Legg seems never to have been seduced by rock. But unlike Leo Kottke or Ry Cooder, whom he also occasionally resembles, Legg is an adventurer, not an archivist."" He is, quite simply, one of the greatest guitarists in the world, and perhaps the very least heralded among that group.","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.

23841,Mt. Wudang: The Sacred Daoist Mountain that Emperor Yongle Built,"Between the years 1412 and 1418 Emperor Yongle of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) constructed of a massive Daoist architectural complex dedicated to the Daoist deity Zhenwu on Mt. Wudang in Hubei province. When Yongle took over Mt. Wudang, the mountain range was already filled with temples dedicated to Zhenwu. These temples had been built a hundred or so years earlier by Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) priests, but by the early Ming the structures had fallen into disrepair. Emperor Yongle’s motivation to reconstruct the temples stemmed from his belief that Zhenwu had aided him in his usurpation of the throne a decade earlier. Yongle not only rebuilt dozens of temples to Zhenwu on Mt. Wudang in the new architectural style of the Ming court, including one cast in bronze for the summit of the mountain, he also sponsored the production of steles, gazetteers, woodblock prints, and painted handscrolls in order to record Zhenwu’s “auspicious responses” to his construction project. In this lecture I will investigate the many ways in which Yongle’s architectural contributions to Mt. Wudang were promoted through these various mediums. I argue that Yongle was successful in rebranding the sacred site of Mt. Wudang as a product of his own creation, despite the fact that he relied almost entirely on the preexisting temple configurations and meanings when constructing it.

38598,CSEAS Noon Lecture Series. Civility and Dispossession in the New Saigon,"Today’s Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon, is a city of contrasts. New luxury housing developments rise from the rubble of demolished neighborhoods. Emergent forms of property rights, known in Vietnam as “land-use rights,” have produced both new real estate opportunities and unprecedented rates of dispossession. This talk, based on research informing my new book, Luxury and Rubble: Civility and Dispossession in the New Saigon, will focus on two cases. On one side of the city, a new urban zone named Phú Mỹ Hưng is commonly said to have “risen from the swamps” and to have transformed a “wasteland” into a space of civilized living. It is a place of hope and aspiration that promises to deliver new models for urban development, transparent governance, and social consciousness. On the other side of the city, in a place called Thủ Thiêm, thousands of households are being evicted from prime real estate located at a bend in the river immediately across from downtown Saigon. This area was also commonly described as an empty wasteland, despite the fact that entire neighborhoods had to be demolished in order to “clear the land.” Tracing the tensions embodied in these two sites, I show how the politics of civility and rights are often entangled with dispossession. In the process, a central paradox emerges: on the one hand, the logic of property rights emboldens residents to stand up for their rights in the face of dispossession; on the other hand, this very same logic of property rights fuels the real estate boom that currently drives mass-dispossession.",Map School of Social Work Building - 1636 School of Social Work Building,['2017-03-31 12:00'],"['Discussion', 'International', 'Research', 'Southeast asia']",

About the Painter & Poets Project: In the fall of 2014, the U-M Institute for the Humanities in collaboration with the Department of English Language and Literature launched the Painter & Poets project. For four weeks, Brooklyn-based artist Frank Born set up studio in MLB as an institute visiting artist. Seven U-M poets were invited to participate in this unique project, each taking time out from their busy schedules to sit for Frank to paint their portraits, totaling 25-30 hours each over the course of his artist residency. The project honors these remarkable creative people in our midst, their ideas and contributions, and the great value of poetry as a marker of human experience. It also serves to encourage the potential synergy between visual gesture and the written word. Lastly, like the proverbial “flower on the freeway,” the painter’s open studio in MLB—surrounded by the frenetic comings and goings of campus—served as a reminder to slow down, take notice, have conversations, and engage, enriched by one another. –Amanda Krugliak, arts curator Born in Texas and educated at Duke University, Frank Born has made a cultural home for himself in both his home state and his adoptive cities of San Francisco and Brooklyn, New York. He is best known for his idiosyncratic, gestural paintings. His commitment to the the process of painting—the exchange between painter and subject—results in surprisingly intimate yet thoroughly modern portraits, complex yet unencumbered. He has exhibited widely and in both galleries and museums.","Map 202 S. Thayer - Institute for the Humanities, Lobby",['2015-04-02 17:00'],"['Art', 'Poetry', 'Visual arts']",

He has held posts at the Japanese Embassies in China, the U.S., Malaysia, and Belgium. He joined the Detroit Consulate in 2013. Abstract The U.S. and Japan share basic values such as freedom, democracy, human rights, and rule of law. We enjoy close economic, cultural, and people-to-people exchanges. The U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of Japan’s security. Japan’s relationship with the U.S. and China was the decisive factor for its destiny during the early 20th century, and their influence continues to this day. Japan’s choice is not a simple selection between the U.S. or China. It is clear, however, that the U.S. remains the most important partner for Japan, while it is in both countries’ national interest to promote a constructive relationship with China.",Map School of Social Work Building - Room 1636,['2014-10-09 12:00'],"['Chinese studies', 'Japanese studies']",

He is inspired by a desire to place cheerful art underfoot in unexpected places and to embrace the temporary nature of all things. For this exhibit, photographs of his street art installations will be on display. Zinn is a lifelong Michigander with a degree in creative writing from the U-M Residential College, and he worked for many years as a children’s radio host on WCBN and Michigan Radio.

Premature arrest of protein synthesis within the open reading frame elicits a protective response that degrades the incomplete nascent chain. In this response, arrested 80S ribosomes are split into their large and small subunits, allowing assembly of the Ribosome Quality control Complex (RQC), which targets nascent chains for degradation. How the cell recognizes arrested nascent chains among the vast pool of actively translating polypeptides is poorly understood. We systematically examined translation arrest and modification of nascent chains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to characterize the steps that couple arrest to RQC targeting. We propose that cells target arresting ribosomes and that this targeting event is a precondition for the RQC to engage the incomplete nascent chain and facilitate its degradation.

In this context, we have investigated the molecular beam epitaxial growth and characterization of nearly defect-free AlGaN nanowire heterostructures grown on Si and sapphire substrate. We have demonstrated AlGaN nanowire LEDs that can operate efficiently in the UV-B (280-320 nm) and UV-C (< 280 nm) bands. The devices exhibit excellent current-voltage characteristics (electrical efficiency > 70%) and optical performance (internal quantum efficiency > 80%). With a detailed characterization and understanding of the formation of quantum-dot-like nanostructures in nearly defect-free AlGaN nanowires, we have further demonstrated AlGaN nanowire lasers that can operate in the UV-B and UV-C bands under electrical injection. In addition, III-nitrides are the only known material whose energy bandgap can straddle the redox potential of water under deep visible and near-infrared light irradiation. We have recently discovered that the quantum efficiency for overall water splitting and hydrogen generation on Ga(In)N nanowires can be enhanced by nearly two orders of magnitude by precisely tuning the surface Fermi-level through controlled dopant incorporation. The monolithic integration of III-nitride nanowires with Si solar cells for achieving high efficiency, highly stable solar-to-hydrogen conversion will also be discussed.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-02-15 12:00'],"['Physics', 'Science']",

28270,Communion of the Apostles and Its Iconographic Variants: Reassessing the Met Epimanikia (10.168.1 and 10.168.2),"The Communion of the Apostles is a theme common to Byzantine icons, textiles, and mural cycles. Two embroidered epimanikia, or liturgical cuffs, now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art display this subject not uncommon to such liturgical objects worn by Orthodox priests during liturgical celebrations. The Met cuffs, however, present a variant of the theme that suggests, as I argue in this paper, a different original form and function for these two objects--different from the ones assumed once the embroideries were trimmed and paired. In exploring the iconographical variants of the Communion of the Apostles theme, especially as they appeared on liturgical embroideries beginning in the fifteenth century in the Byzantine-Slavic cultural sphere, I seek to reconstruct the original forms and functions of the Met cuffs.",Map Tisch Hall - 1014,['2016-03-23 12:00'],"['Discussion', 'Graduate', 'Scholarship']",

The trio’s self-titled debut disc is exuberant in its playing, welcoming in its attitude. Though the lyrics have a melancholic undercurrent, the tracks are more often rave-ups than ruminations, with swelling three-part harmonies and rousing group-sung choruses, especially on the electric guitar-driven “The One You Should’ve Let Go” and “Green Eyes and A Heart of Gold,” a we-will-survive anthem that could be about a family or a band.

Gallery Talk by Nancy De Los Santos and exhibition curator Maria Cotera: Friday, February 17, 2017 at 12 pm, Walter P. Reuther Library Woodcock Conference Room Walter P. Reuther Library at Wayne State University 5401 Cass Ave, Detroit, MI 48202 Born and raised in Chicago by Mexican-American parents, Nancy De Los Santos is an accomplished filmmaker and proud “Chicana from Chicago” who has dedicated her life and career to rewriting and redefining the image of Latina/os in the mainstream media. Among her most celebrated works are as Co-Writer and Co-Producer of The Bronze Screen: 100 Years of the Latin Image in Hollywood Cinema, with Susan Racho and Alberto Dominguez, and as Associate Producer on the feature film Selena. In Chicana Fotos, an exhibit of evocative photographs taken in the 1970s, we meet a very different Nancy: a woman armed with a camera, capturing historic events in the struggles for social justice of the time. Nancy’s photographs of Chicano Movement marches and rallies, farmworker mobilizations in Chicago and Texas, and Latina organizing in the Midwest and internationally offer a priceless documentary view of Latina/o politics in the 1970s. Her more intimate pictures of everyday Latina/o life capture what it was like to live through a period of radical social transformation. The exhibit includes rare photographs of UFW organizing activities in Chicago, the Texas Farmworker Pilgrimage of 1977, and the first ever International Women’s Year Conference in Mexico City in 1975. These images are supplemented by never before exhibited documents from the Walter P. Reuther UFW Collection. Chicana Fotos was curated by University of Michigan professor Maria Cotera (with assistance from Pau Nava) and designed by students and faculty of the UM Stamps School of Art & Design. Stamps School faculty Hannah Smotrich and Katie Rubin co-taught the collaborative, interdisciplinary Exhibition Design class with students Ian Crowley, Rachel Dawson, Emilie Farrugia, Kelsi Franzino, Andrew Han, Jack Hyland, Maggie Lemak, Megan Lewin-Smith, Katie Mongoven, Olivia Moore, Pau Nava, and Sarah Wolf. Chicana Fotos is a collaboration between the El Museo del Norte, the Chicana por mi Raza Digital Archive, the Stamps School of Art & Design and the Walter P. Reuther Library at Wayne State University. The Walter P. Reuther Library of Labor and Urban Affairs at Wayne State University is the largest labor archive in North America. In addition to internationally significant collections on the history of the North American labor movement, the Reuther Library holds the official records of Wayne State University, as well as extensive records documenting urban affairs, civic life, civil rights, ethnic and religious organizations, and community development across Southeast Michigan. Chicana Fotos was made possible through the generous financial support of the University of Michigan’s Third Century Initiative and the Stamps School of Art & Design.

Sidney Rittenberg arrived in China as a GI Chinese language expert at the end of World War II. Discharged there, he joined the Chinese Communist Party, and was an active participant in the Chinese communist revolution and its aftermath. An intimate of the Party's leadership, including Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, he gained prominence at the Broadcast Administration, one of the most important agencies of government. Over a five-year period, award-winning former-CBS journalist and China specialist, Irv Drasnin, interviewed Rittenberg to produce a compelling, complex and unique understanding of the 20th century's biggest revolution. From Sid first meeting Mao in the caves of Yan'an, to his becoming famous and powerful during the Cultural Revolution, to his battling insanity in solitary, his journey and his profound insight illuminate a much greater history--a history few Chinese are aware of, let alone many Americans, told by an American who was there.",Map Angell Hall - Auditorium A,['2013-02-16 19:00'],"['Chinese studies', 'Revolutionary', 'Rittenberg']",

Muslim Pathways: Ethics of Cohabitation, Assembly, and Informality","Drawing upon field research in different Muslim cities, Professor Haines analyzes the diverse ways modernity reshapes community, belonging, and cohabitation through the mapping and policing of a diversity of borders: between modernity and tradition, centers and peripheries, wealthy and poor, as well as between national territories. He questions how crossing borders and disrupting normative claims to purifying the ‘in-group’ become contested aspirations and practices to forge new kinds of community, ones often rooted in Islamic ideals and ethics. Chad Haines is a cultural anthropologist and assistant professor of Religious Studies and Global Studies at Arizona State University. He earned his PhD in Cultural Anthropology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2000). Haines’ publications include Nation, Territory, and Globalization in Pakistan: Traversing the Margins (Routledge 2012) that analyzes the mapping of marginal spaces within the nation-making processes of Pakistan, particularly focusing on the remote, mountainous northern region of Gilgit-Baltistan. He is co-editor of Women and Peace in the Islamic World: Gender, Agency, and Influence (I.B. Taurus 2015) and the forthcoming People’s Peace: Prospects for a Human Future. He is currently completing a manuscript titled: Muslim Pathways: Negotiating Modernity, Religion, and Urbanity. Before moving to ASU, Haines taught at American University in Cairo (2004-2008) and was a Senior Fulbright Research Fellow in Pakistan (2009). He held a number of visiting and research positions at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill’s University Center for International Studies, at Duke University’s Center for South Asian Studies, the Center for Civilizational Dialogue in the University of Malaysia, and the Center for the Study of Religion and Conflict at ASU. ** For CMENAS students only ** 1:30-2 pm — CMENAS students workshop/discussion with the lecturer/professor.",Map School of Social Work Building - Room 1636,['2016-10-10 12:00'],"['Anthropology', 'International', 'Middle east studies']",

Both topics become considerably more complicated in the case of large-dimensional data sets where the set of specification possibilities can become quite large. In the context of linear regression models, penalised regression has become the de facto benchmark technique used to trade off parsimony and fit when the number of possible covariates is large, often much larger than the number of available observations. However, issues such as the choice of a penalty function and tuning parameters associated with the use of penalized regressions remain contentious. In this paper, we provide an alternative approach that considers the statistical significance of the individual covariates one at a time, whilst taking full account of the multiple testing nature of the inferential problem involved. We refer to the proposed method as One Covariate at a Time Multiple Testing (OCMT) procedure  The OCMT provides an alternative to penalised regression methods: It is based on statistical inference and is therefore easier to interpret and relate to the classical statistical analysis, it allows working under more general assumptions, it is faster, and performs well in small samples for almost all of the different sets of experiments considered in this paper. Despite its simplicity, the theory behind the proposed approach is quite complicated. We provide extensive theoretical and Monte Carlo results in support of adding the proposed OCMT model selection procedure to the toolbox of applied researchers.",Map West Hall - 411,['2016-09-09 11:30'],['Seminar'],

Trans-imperial History and the North-South Divide,"Through the lens of Ottoman history, I will argue for the necessity of understanding history across imperial (and national) boundaries in order to dislodge the firmly entrenched conceptual North-South divide. It is crucial that we understand how the all-but-accepted assumptions of a standard North-South relations (ruler/ruled, colonizer/colonized, South-to-North migration. etc) grew out of a specific historical moment during the age of High Imperialism and was later emphasized through the telling of history from a European imperial perspective. Exploring an alternative narrative, would allow us to better understand how global policies (from refugee policies, to the focus of the international criminal court) could reshaped through a dismantling of a Euro-centric historical narrative. Mostafa Minawi is an assistant professor of history at Cornell University and the director of the Ottoman and Turkish Studies Initiative at Cornell University. His research explores late Ottoman historical through a trans-imperial lens.

20448,"Lecture: ""Matter of Contention: Relics of the Biblical Past Between Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity,"" Ra'anan Boustan, University of California, Los Angeles","Abstract: During the period of late antiquity (ca. 200–800 CE), Jews and Christians in the Mediterranean world were fascinated by the fate of artifacts associated with sacrificial cult of the Jerusalem Temple and the royal house of ancient Israel. The presence of such objects—as word, image, relic, or replica—had the capacity to imbue people, places, and ritual practices with authority and even sanctity. This paper explores how such “biblical” artifacts were recruited into a variety of often competing religious or ideological projects, but also how they helped to generate shared idioms of power that crossed religious and social boundaries. Contestation between Jews and Christian over the ownership, function, or meaning of these objects also illuminates how religious communities shape each other’s understandings of sacred matter and even of materiality itself. Ra‘anan Boustan is an Associate Professor in the Ancient and Jewish history fields in the Department of History at UCLA. Boustan is a historian of religion whose research and teaching focus on the dynamic intersections between Judaism and other Mediterranean religious traditions, with a special interest in the impact of Romanization and Christianization on Jewish culture and society in late antiquity. Boustan is the author of From Martyr to Mystic: Rabbinic Martyrology and the Making of Merkavah Mysticism (2005), has published widely in leading journals such as The Jewish Quarterly Review, Jewish Studies Quarterly, and Medieval Encounters. He has also co-edited eight volumes, most recently a special issue of the journal Archiv für Religionsgeschichte on “Authoritative Traditions and Ritual Power in the Ancient World” (forthcoming 2015). He is currently writing a book entitled The Holy Remains: Tokens of Cult and Kingship between Jews and Christians in Late Antiquity, which traces the history of sacred objects associated with the ancient Israelite past within Jewish and Christian cultures in late antiquity.

If the trees are duals to sphere systems one can give a description of the core using the intersection patterns of spheres. We investigate how the core changes along a surgery sequence.

We are developing novel optical methods to elucidate the interdependence of molecular organization, lipid phase, and membrane curvature. With near-field fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy, we have resolved the single-molecule cross-linking of membrane proteins in the initial stage of an immunological response on living cells. With polarized localization microscopy, we have measured membrane curvature as small as 20 nm radii of curvature and correlated molecular reorganization. Recently, we have discovered that cholera toxin subunit B self-assembles to form nanoscale membrane buds in quasi-one component bilayers to facilitate its immobilization and internalization into cells. We will discuss the physics of these optical methods and what they have taught us about the biophysics of membranes.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1300 Chemistry,['2016-11-18 16:00'],"['Biophysics', 'Chemistry']",

15791,To Build a Better Vulva: Knowledge and Practice in American Genital Sex Reassignment Surgery,"Following the closure of university-based gender clinics in the early 1980s, American surgeons who performed transsexual genital sex reassignment surgery (GSRS) became isolated by geography, the ethical contentiousness of their work, and the demands of a competitive market. There is no consensus, surgical or otherwise, as to the proper form and function of the genitals produced in GSRS. As such, surgeons have developed their own stylistic and technical approaches to these procedures, resulting in distinctly different outcomes for patients. In this talk Prof. Plemons examines how contested forms of knowledge about the female genitals are negotiated in the practice of one American surgeon. Trans- patients negotiate these forms of knowledge–which are situated awkwardly between medical and feminist claims to know and represent “natural genitals”–in order to generate the “realistic expectations” that are a condition of receiving GSRS.",Map Lane Hall - 2239,['2014-01-29 16:00'],"['Anthropology', 'Gender', 'Lgbtq', 'Medicine', 'Sexual health', 'Transgender']",

36554,Conversations on Europe. Security Crises: Extreme Nationalism and Threats to Democracy in Europe,"Since the sovereign debt crisis hit Europe in 2010, there has been a resurgence of right or extreme nationalist parties in virtually every former Western European country and in some Eastern European countries. Analysts at first viewed these “minor” upticks as a passing sign of fringe voter discontent. The move to the right did not go away and has gained momentum even in countries such as Social Democratic Sweden where the idea of a right nationalist party polling at 25% would have been unthinkable even a year ago. The combination of ongoing financial crisis and the current migration crisis appears to be a harbinger of unspecified disaster—if the EU cannot come up with policies soon that adjudicate these dual crises. Many commentators and some academics have argued that this right nationalist resurgence signals a return of the politics of the 1930s. This talk takes on these issues and addresses the ways in which that assessment is plausible. Mabel Berezin is a professor of sociology at Cornell who writes on challenges to democratic cohesion and solidarity in Europe and the United States. She is the author of ""Illiberal Politics in Neoliberal Times: Culture, Security, and Populism in the New Europe"" (Cambridge 2009) and ""Making the Fascist Self: The Political Culture of Inter-war Italy"" (Cornell 1997).

14616,CREES Noon Lecture,"Elena Osokina, professor of Russian history, University of South Carolina. In the 1930s, to aid Soviet industrialization the Stalinist leadership sold antiques and art abroad literally by the thousands of tons. It was unfortunate for the USSR that the most active period in the art export coincided with the world economic crisis. Market prices, including those for art, dropped drastically. To fulfill its “currency targets” the Soviet government had to shift from the export of ordinary antiques to masterpieces, including major works of art from the Hermitage. The masterpieces sold by the Soviet government to finance industrialization became important holdings of many world famous museums. This talk will explore the impact that Stalin’s art export had on building the core of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and the role of the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon, who became one of the most famous buyers of art from the Soviet museums. Elena A. Osokina, professor of Russian history at the University of South Carolina, received her Ph.D. from the Department of History at Moscow University, Russia. She is the author of Gold for Industrialization: Torgsin (Rosspen, 2009, in Russian), Our Daily Bread: Socialist Distribution and the Art of Survival in Stalin’s Russia, 1927-1941 (M.E.

She is currently engaged in a research project, “Rembrandts for Tractors,” that explores the social, economic and cultural effects of the Soviet mass art exports under Stalin to finance Soviet industrialization.

His major scholarly work includes The Masculine Self (fourth edition, Sloan Publishing, 2010), Men’s Violence Against Women: Theory, Research, and Activism (with Julie Allison, Erlbaum, 2007), The Pain Behind the Mask: Overcoming Masculine Depression (with John Lynch, 1999) and Sexual Assault in Context: Teaching College Men about Gender (with Alan Berkowitz, Erlbaum, 2005), a manual based on his consultation experiences. Kilmartin recently concluded a three-year consultation with the U.S. Naval Academy on a revision of sexual assault and harassment prevention curriculum. He participated as a consultant in the U.S. Department of Education’s 2001 Meeting on Violence Prevention in Higher Education. In addition, Kilmartin delivered the keynote address at the NCAA’s first violence prevention summit held in Indianapolis.

24877,"Michigan’s Online Court Project: Improving Access, Accuracy, and Fairness","Courts are designed to help members of society resolve outstanding disputes in a fair and efficient manner. Yet, as the daily news and common experience make plain, courts remain surprisingly difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to use. Even for the most minor of issues (which is most of what courts do), accessing our justice system invariably requires an in-person, face-to-face interaction with the right person, under the right conditions, with the right documents, during business hours, often after waiting in an hours-long line. The people who suffer most as a result of this outmoded approach are those who can least afford it. Even for trivial issues, physically going to court requires taking time off of work. For hourly workers, this is expensive, perhaps prohibitively so. For many others, taking time off to address an issue isn't even possible, not without risking their jobs. Moreover, if the issue involved is confusing, or if money is due, many understandably fear what might happen to them if they do find a way to get to court (e.g., arrest). Confusion and fear are two of the reasons there are tens of millions of outstanding warrants for minor issues in the United States. Michigan’s Online Court Project has partnered with several state courts to allow citizens to resolve certain tickets and violations, warrants, outstanding fines, and missed court dates online, on their own time, working directly with judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement to reach mutually satisfying resolutions. This is no ""rubber stamp"" reform; in fact, the technology can improve decision making, making outcomes more accurate and fair. If done right, implementing cutting-edge, Internet-based technologies in our courts has the potential to dramatically enhance access to justice for all citizens, especially those long left out in the cold. ",2245 North Quad,['2015-09-24 12:00'],[],

36656,Macroeconomics: Missing Growth from Creative Destruction,"Abstract: Statistical agencies typically impute inflation for disappearing products from the inflation rate for surviving products. As some products disappear precisely because they are displaced by better products, inflation may be lower at these points than for surviving products. As a result, creative destruction may result in overstated inflation and understated growth. We use a simple model to relate this “missing growth” to the frequency and size of various kinds of innovations. Using U.S. Census data, we then apply two ways of assessing the magnitude of missing growth for all private nonfarm businesses for 1983–2013. The first approach exploits information on the market share of surviving plants. The second approach applies indirect inference to firm-level data. We find: (i) missing growth from imputation is substantial — 0.5 percentage points per year when using the first approach, 1 percentage point per year using the second method; and (ii) almost all of the missing growth is due to creative destruction (as opposed to new varieties).",Map Lorch Hall - 201,['2017-03-22 16:00'],"['Economics', 'Seminar']",

We argue this is because voters don’t just ask themselves “which party best represents my policy preferences?” but also ask “how is someone like me supposed to vote?” Voters don’t just consider their personal preferences. They also consider the expectations of the salient groups with which they identify. These expectations are social norms, shared beliefs about what constitutes appropriate behavior for members of the identity group, and individuals’ choices reflect trade-offs between personal interests and adherence to norms. We illustrate this claim with survey experiments on representative samples of the US and British populations examining the group identity component of ideological self-placement and documenting norms that discourage voting against one's group and encourage support for the policies normatively associated with one’s group. We directly measure these norms and show that they influence real-stakes voting behavior when group identity is salient.",Map North Quad - 3100 (Ehrlicher Room),['2016-10-24 15:30'],"['Economics', 'Seminar']",

High-energy-density matter is defined as matter at more than 1 million atmospheres of pressure (>1 Mbar). In many cases, we can compress and heat matter to more than 1 billion atmospheres of pressure (>1 Gbar) and more than 10 million °K (>1 keV). These are pressures relevant to the interior of stars and gas giant planets. We can also use these experimental systems to create matter at conditions similar to the conditions found in accretion discs surrounding black holes and in the photospheres of white dwarf stars. The properties and dynamics of matter in these regimes are still largely unexplored. In this talk, I will give an overview of how we use pulsed-power-driven techniques to generate this matter. I will also discuss several relevant applications, including inertial confinement fusion (ICF), radiation physics, radiation effects science, laboratory astrophysics, and material properties.

He stepped out on his own in the 1970s with a swampy, gravelly Southern-psychedelia fusion sound and became one of the top-grossing concert acts in the world. Russell had a country alter ego named Hank Wilson, and his pen produced a string of roots rock classics including his own hit ""Tight Rope."" Back when rock was at its best, it contained a little bit of everything: pop, jazz, R&B, country, soul, gospel, novelty music, and more—and it was often Leon Russell who filled up the pot and stirred it.

Musical improvisation is captured as choreographic experience, then encoded into digital animation and 3D-printed sculptural forms. The performances are transformed by their conversion into visual media: sound is removed, movement is abstracted from human anatomy into non-representational geometry, and time is rendered as space. Removed creates a dialogue between the intuitive and the formalized, and invites questions about the nature of translation and the absences it conceals. Join us for an exhibit reception on Tuesday, September 13th. Christopher Burns is a composer, improviser, and multimedia artist whose works explore collage, layering, and the use of generative algorithms to form and develop both musical and visual elements. His work creates a dialogue between complexity and clarity, incorporating densely braided, rapidly shifting materials alongside gradually evolving, linearly directed textures.

The first half-century of British photography charts the journey of a new medium with distinct expressive and artistic potentials. Photography served as an aid to science and exploration but also captured aspects of British society in ways that are poetic and artistic. Some photographers demonstrated an interest in social reform while others revealed sentimental notions of the island’s remote past. By the end of the century, advances in camera speeds and printing techniques facilitated landscape photography and other picturesque Victorian scenes.

Realizing that percussion instruments can communicate all the extremes of emotion and musical possibility, it has not been an easy music to define. Called “astonishing and entrancing” by Billboard Magazine, “brilliant” by the New York Times, the Brooklyn based quartet's innovative work with today's most exciting composers and their own original music has quickly helped them forge a unique and diverse career. With an audience comprised of ""both kinds of blue hair... elderly matron here, arty punk there"" (as the Boston Globe described it), SÃ´ Percussion makes a rare and wonderful breed of music that both compels instantly and offers vast rewards for engaged listening.

24202,Smith Lecture: Greenland’s Climate Past and Future: Insights from Paleolimnology,"How unusual is recent warming in the Arctic? How do arctic environments really respond to warming climate? Geologic records can provide some answers. Specifically, insolation-driven warmth across the Arctic during the Last Interglacial period (ca. 130 to 116 thousand years ago) and the early to middle Holocene (ca. 9-5 thousand years ago) provides geologically accessible analogs for future arctic warming and its impacts. And by providing a picture of what a warmer Arctic really looks like, paleoclimate reconstructions from these past warm periods can be used to test and improve climate and ice sheet models. This talk will describe recent efforts to reconstruct the warm climates of the Last Interglacial and early Holocene on and near Greenland using insect assemblages preserved in lake sediments. Terrestrial temperature reconstructions for the Last Interglacial are rare in the heavily glaciated North Atlantic Arctic region due to widespread erosion of sediments by continental ice sheets during the Last Glacial Maximum. To address this problem, we exploit special glacial geologic settings where cold-based Pleistocene ice cover preserved ancient lake sediments in situ. In contrast, Holocene lake sediment records are widespread across the region, allowing for comparison of records across an ever-growing network of sites. Our reconstructed Holocene summer temperature anomalies are larger than those typically inferred from annually-integrated indicators from the ice sheet itself, agree well with the timing of climate shifts inferred from other archives, and suggest significant spatial heterogeneity of Holocene climate change around Greenland. Future work will apply geochemical proxy methods (oxygen isotopes of aquatic organic materials and hydrogen isotopes of leaf waxes) in parallel with insect-based reconstructions to infer additional aspects of climate during the Holocene and Last Interglacial.",Map Clarence Cook Little Building - 1528,['2015-10-09 15:30'],['Lecture'],

This declaration staged “blight” as a catastrophic threat to public health, safety, security, and well-being on the same order as the other disasters listed in Michigan’s Emergency Management Act, including “hazardous radiological incident,” “hostile military or paramilitary action,” and “terrorist activities, riots, or civil disorders.” Less than a year later, the Detroit Blight Task Force announced that it had discovered over 80,000 blighted buildings in Detroit; according to the Task Force, these buildings were necessary to demolish and $850 million was required to carry out this program of urban destruction. As these events indicate, current efforts to detect, eliminate, and prevent “blight” in Detroit are prompting novel expansions of state authority, enormous public expenditures, and potentially drastic alterations of the built environment. And yet, the history of “blight” as an urban crisis soliciting radical political, economic, and social re-organization has yet to receive sustained critical or scholarly attention. With a few signal exceptions, discussions of “blight” have proceeded in dehistoricized and depoliticized contexts oriented around narrow technical parameters, as if “blight” was an easily defined and objective phenomenon instead of the spatial residue of racism and segregation, deindustrialization, disinvestment, and other fraught dynamics of American urban history. Organized by Assoc. Prof. Andrew Herscher, this workshop will draw together scholars and activists whose work has contributed to the framing of blight as a topic of critical scholarly and public attention in order to pose “blight” as an object of interdisciplinary inquiry, informed public debate, and considered urban action.",Map Art and Architecture Building - East Review Space,['2015-02-16 15:00'],"['Architecture', 'Detroit', 'Politics', 'Public policy', 'Social impact', 'Social justice']",

Her video piece ""Accent Elimination,"" which was included in the 2015 Venice Biennale as part of the Armenian exhibition, was inspired by her parents and their accents and life stories, which suggest that the question as to where a person comes from is not so simple to answer, and the answers speak to a larger family story about displacement migration, intermarriage, and diaspora. With the help of an “accent elimination” coach, Katchadourian sets out to learn to speak in her parents’ accents, and for them to acquire a “standard American accent.” As the video reflects, it proves to be a moving, confusing, frustrating and often hilarious experience.",Map 202 S.

Scythian's high-energy, adrenaline-peddling, interactive brand of music is the result of their origins as street performers and has one goal in mind - to get people up on their feet and dancing. Their repertoire ranges from traditional and contemporary Celtic and folk music to the alluring and dramatic strains of Gypsy and Eastern European tunes, and then crosses back over the border to pick up some good old-fashioned bluegrass licks. Scythian is: Josef Crosby (fiddle/bass), Alexander (fiddle/mandolin) & Danylo Fedoryka (accordion/guitar), Ben-David Warner (fiddle/banjo) and Andrew Toy (percussion).","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.

12688,"""Engaging Diversity; More Important Than Ever,"" Talk by Pat Gurin, Nancy Cantor Lecture","Three key challenges compel the United States to deepen and to cement its engagement with diversity in higher education. One, the demographic challenge: The United States will be a majority-minority country sometime around 2045. That new reality will oblige us to talk and solve problems across ethnic/racial communities and other dissimilarities. Colleges and universities will continue to be the primary venues where dialogue and collaborative skills can be fostered. Short of major changes in racial/ethnic residential patterns and urban-rural divisions, K-12 schools will continue to be highly segregated, minimizing possibilities for younger people to gain intercultural skills. Two, the democracy challenge: All members of society must be offered a place at the table of community and political discourse. The dramatic increase in economic inequality and a corresponding drop in upward mobility in the U.S. has given rise to political fault-lines drawn between the “haves” and “have-nots.” Now more than ever, the United States requires leaders who are comfortable and effective crossing class, racial/ethnic, rural-urban boundaries to create inclusive political communities of people from all walks of life. Third, the dispersion challenge: In what Fareed Zakaria calls “the rise of the rest,” many other nations are growing economically and demanding to share leadership and power in the world. Higher education is the primary institution for teaching the world’s historical and cultural knowledge, and for assuring that future U.S. leaders are equipped to negotiate, collaborate and dialogue across differences. This lecture will delineate the importance of engaging diversity so that higher education produces leaders who can address these demographic, democracy, and dispersion challenges. Professor Gurin will present social science evidence on the educational benefit of diversity that has played a role in legal challenges to affirmative action. She will draw especially from a large-scale, multi-university experimental study of intergroup dialogue, a program, first launched in the 1990s at the University of Michigan, that has spread across many colleges and universities here and abroad, to teach the kinds of sentiments and skills that people will increasingly need in order to be effective leaders in 2lst century global relationships. Patricia Gurin, Ph.D. is Nancy Cantor Distinguished University Professor Emerita of Psychology and Women's Studies; Faculty Associate, Research Center for Group Dynamics, Institute for Social Research; and Director of Research, Program on Intergroup Relations.

31690,Conversations on Europe. Italian Style: Fashion and Film,"Italian cinema launched Italian fashion to the world. This lecture is based on Professor Paulicelli’s latest book, ""Italian Style: Fashion & Film from Early Cinema to the Digital Age,"" which tells the story of this launch. The creation of an Italian style and fashion as they are perceived today, especially by foreigners, was a product of the post World War II years. Before then, Parisian fashion had dominated Europe and the world, and had helped shape a Parisian and French identity. The lecture explores how film contributed to the shaping of an Italian style and fashion that ran parallel to and at times took the lead in the creation of an Italian national identity. Fashion and film are powerful industries and media machines that construct powerful symbolic narratives and identities. It is hardly surprising, then, that Italian filmmakers have been fascinated by the transformative power of the language of clothing and fashion and the impact it has on style, consumption, and behavior. Eugenia Paulicelli is professor of Italian and comparative literature at Queens College and The Graduate Center of the City University of New York. She is the founder and director of fashion studies in the MA in liberal studies and PhD concentration at The Graduate Center. She has published several books as author and editor. In her writing she has explored the intersections between word and image in literature, cinema, fashion, and the media; the impact of technology in shaping these intersections; and the history and role of women in relation to fashion, the visual arts, and writing (literature and journalism).",Map School of Social Work Building - 1636,['2016-10-24 16:00'],"['European', 'Film', 'International', 'Media', 'Visual arts']",

By bringing waiting in history to the fore, this proect seeks to lead the debate on time away from the existential themes that have dominated its exploration.

William Meadow, MD, PhD, will present a talk entitled, “Mathematics of Morality in the NICU.” Abstract: Most traditional discussions of neonatal ethics center on issues of beneficence, justice, autonomy, and best interests. My talk does not. Rather, I attempt to show how data impact decision-making in the NICU. I will discuss four separate, but related, issues – Money, Outcomes, Prediction, and Worth. I will demonstrate that there are no credible financial criticisms of NICU care, especially when compared to adult ICU care. I will discuss the paradox that although survival outcomes vary sharply with gestational age (GA), the outcomes for infants who actually survive do not vary much with GA. I will spend considerable time on the possibility of very accurate prediction of either death or neurodevelopmental impairment for infants – while they are on the ventilator in the NICU when ethical alternatives to continued NICU care (i.e., extubation and palliative care) are possible. And finally I will spend a bit of time discussing the odd but consistent finding that many people (physicians and non-physicians alike) appear to place less value on the life of a micro-preemie than they do on other medical patients with comparable, or even worse, prognoses. I will end with a discussion of the future of neonatal morality research, as I see it. Dr. Meadow is a Professor of Pediatrics, Co-Section Chief of Neonatology, and Director of the Neonatology Fellowship Program at the University of Chicago. An expert in neonatology, Dr. Meadow's research focuses on medical ethics in the field of neonatal epidemiology. He has examined resource allocation, as well as issues of informed consent, in neonatal intensive care units. Light refreshments will be provided.

The bold designs of the movie posters in the exhibition announced to the public the new revolutionary state in its formative first decade, the 1920's. The movies themselves are still viewed and studied today for their inventive approach to filmmaking. Five of the films advertised by the posters will be screened in February. The final day of the series, February 12, 2016, also features a panel discussion of the Constructivist movement with exhibition curator Lehti Keelmann and U-M faculty. 4:30pm- October/Ten Days that Shook the World, Sergei Eisenstein, 1928 (103 minutes) October re-enacts the beginning of the October Revolution, with its iconic moments such as the storming of the Winter Palace. It is directed by Soviet cinematic great, Sergei Eisenstein (from Riga, Latvia), who participated in the revolution, producing propaganda. The film is dynamic and some of its elements such as the use of banners are visually translated into the accompanying poster. It is significant for its historical context in recounting (through the eyes of the Bolsheviks) the events of the revolution at an early point in the trajectory of the Soviet Union. Though prepared earlier, the film was not released until 1928 due to Stalin's ban on images of Leonid Trotsky, which required certain scenes to be edited out. For Eisenstein, camera angles and the minutea of detail were important. He cultivated a style involving a ""montage of attraction,"" which brought together different theatrical techniques and types of scenes for a composite effect. He used actors and scripts and sought to build intensity from scene to scene. While foreign critics praised his inventive camera angles and montages, they were skeptically received in the Soviet Union, especially after Eisenstein's blockbuster success, The Battleship Potemkin. 6:30pm- Zvenigora, Aleksandr Dovženko, Georgi Astafyev, and Vja?eslaw Ov?innikov, 1927 (67 minutes) Zvenigora combines the tradition of Ukrainian folk tales and poetry with revolutionary ideals and dynamic cinematic practices in early Soviet film. Directed by Ukrainian Alexander Dovženko, the film centers on a hidden treasure in the Ukrainian region of Zvenigora and juxtaposes the past with the present. A grandfather tells the story of the hidden treasure to his two grandsons, who react in different ways. The first, Pavlo, searches for the treasure, becomes a con artist, and eventually commits suicide. The second, Tymishko, becomes a soldier of the revolution (fighting for the Bolsheviks in the Ukrainian Civil War) and discovers that the true treasure of Zvenigora involves working the land to reveal the bounty of agriculture and industry. For Dovženko, the revolution was about understanding how to harness the land for progress. In this vein, the landscape plays an important role in the film. While the film was criticized for being too nationalistic, Dovženko believed that it highlighted the range of his creative abilities and espoused Eisenstein’s “montage of attractions.” The film mediates traditions and national history – the mythical – with a narrative of the New Order – the modern. Produced by VUFKU, Zvenigora is part of a trilogy of silent films centered on Ukraine by Dovženko that also include Arsenal and Earth.",Map Museum of Art - Helmut Stern Auditorium,['2016-02-06 16:30'],"['Film', 'History', 'International', 'Museum', 'Umma']",

Population and community ecology has focused on the impacts of both negative and positive interactions on patterns of community structure and microevolution. However, the impacts of species interactions on broad-scale macroevolutionary patterns across the tree of life remain unclear. For example, all current phylogenetic models of diversification and trait evolution assume that evolution along each branch in a phylogenetic tree is independent of evolution along every other branch - an assumption that precludes any kind of species interactions. I will describe new comparative methods that are designed to investigate the signature of species interactions on macroevolution using phylogenetic comparative data. I will focus on two key questions: Can we detect the influence of species interactions on patterns of trait evolution? and How do species interaction networks evolve?",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1200,['2012-03-22 16:00'],"['Ecology', 'Evolutionary biology']",
9824,Propeller: Shakespeare's Twelfth Night ,"Propeller returns after its much talked-about 2011 performances of Richard III and The Comedy of Errors with new productions of Twelfth Night and The Taming of the Shrew, two comedies full of mistaken identities, transformations, and deceptions that ultimately reveal truth. In The Taming of the Shrew, a man playing a boy dresses up as a girl, which confuses Christopher Sly. In Twelfth Night, a man plays a girl disguised as a boy, which confuses everybody. Both plays explore beautifully how being in love with the wrong person can reveal true feeling. Propeller uses an all-male cast as was done in Shakespeare’s day. Mixing a rigorous approach to the text with a modern physical aesthetic, the company updates the productions in surprising ways, with actors also performing live music. “As directed by Edward Hall, Propeller specializes in knuckle-duster Shakespeare that digs for the harshness beneath the lyricism. Funny, antic, bawdy: the productions are all these expected things. But they also make sure that the chuckles stick in your throat.

17130,MCubed Guest Speaker: Professor Adrian Forty,"Every history of twentieth century architecture repeats the mantra that without concrete, modern architecture would not have happened, that 'modern architecture was born under the sign of reinforced concrete'. But what makes reinforced concrete 'modern'? As a medium, it is as much un-modern as it is modern. Why were architects throughout the twentieth century so determined to promote the modernity of concrete? And what have the consequences of this fixation been - for architecture, and for concrete? Adrian Forty is a distinguished scholar of architecture and design at the Bartlett (UCL) in London. His most recent book, Concrete and Culture, is a favorite of some of our students. Earlier books have been tremendously influential, especially Words and Buildings and Objects of Desire. Adrian is also a major figure in the EAHN (European Architectural History Network).

7932,"“The Connection Between Policy and Practice, Lessons Learned by an Urban Superintendent on the Road to the Broad Prize for Urban Education”  ","Abstract In 2006, with the goal of increasing student achievement, the Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) Board of Education passed policies related to effective teachers and school administrators. The leadership of the District put the Board’s work in action and made increasing staff effectiveness the focus of their work. In the process, staff worked to establish new benchmarks in measuring effective performance including how to: ”¢ Define It: Clearly define and measure effectiveness ”¢ Hire it: Base recruitment on effectiveness ”¢ Develop it: Provide access to training ”¢ Instill it: Make it part of the culture ”¢ Manage it: Provide readily available, accurate and timely data ”¢ Pay for it: Revise compensation structure to reflect a focus on performance. The path was often controversial and difficult, but student achievement increased substantially more than other U.S. urban school districts. CMS was selected as the 2011 winner of the Broad Prize for Urban Education. The $1 million Broad Prize, established in 2002, is the largest education award in the country given to school districts. The Broad Prize is awarded each year to honor urban school districts that demonstrate the greatest overall performance and improvement in student achievement while reducing achievement gaps among low-income and minority students. Peter C. Gorman brings more than two decades of experience in education to his role as Senior Vice President of Education Services for News Corporation. He began his career as a second-grade teacher in Orlando, Florida. He worked as a teacher, principal and district-level administrator in Orange, Seminole and Osceola counties in Florida before becoming superintendent of schools in Tustin, California. In 2006, he became superintendent of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools in North Carolina. Under his leadership, the district won the 2011 Broad Prize in Urban Education, which recognizes increases in student achievement and closing of achievement gaps. Gorman graduated from Michigan State University with a bachelor’s degree in elementary education. He also holds a master’s in business administration from Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, and a master’s and doctorate in education leadership from the University of Central Florida.",Map School of Education - Schorling Auditorium,['2012-01-17 16:00'],"['Education', 'Education policy', 'Ford school of public policy', 'Public policy', 'Urban education', 'Urban planning']",

The data sets comprise structured sequences of syllables or ‘songs’ produced by animals from different genotypes under different experimental conditions. The primary goals are to elucidate the roles of different genotypes and experimental conditions on animal vocalization behaviors and also to learn complex serial dependency structures and systematic patterns in the vocalizations. We are developing novel statistical methods based on first and higher order Markovian dynamics that help answer these important scientific queries. The methods have appealing theoretical properties and practical advantages and are of very broad utility, with applications not limited to analysis of animal vocalization experiments.

As many in the DH community have pointed out, the field remains dominated by work within the Anglo-American geographies and linguistic fields. The goal of this symposium and workshop is to help to fulfill its global promise by creating an intellectual space for a series of dialogues between scholars, librarians, and archivists about how DH can be done by, and what DH means for, scholars working in area studies disciplines and, in turn, how this new field can shape the futures of Japanese studies in the twenty-first century.

In the aggregate, these stochastic, dynamical networks of interaction regulate colony behavior. Ants are extremely diverse, and species differences in collective behavior reflect relations with diverse environments. A long-term study of desert seed-eating ants shows that colonies regulate foraging activity according to food availability and current humidity. Colonies differ in how they regulate foraging behavior. Matching parent and offspring colonies made it possible to estimate a life table for this population of colonies and to ask how collective behavior is evolving in current drought conditions. It appears that colonies that regulate foraging so as to conserve water are having more offspring colonies. Studies of other species, such as tropical arboreal ants in Mexico, and the invasive Argentine ant in northern California, suggest how different collective algorithms evolve in other environmental conditions.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1210,['2013-10-24 16:00'],"['Ecology', 'Evolutionary biology']",

29331,Exhibition Presentations: Research Through Making,"The University of Michigan's Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning presents...Research Through Making. Historically, research and creative practice have been constructed as ""opposites."" This is not an unusual struggle in architecture schools, particularly in the context of a research university. This perceived tension between design and research is indicative of age-old anxieties within the architecture field to understand its nature as an ""applied art."" Design can be a purely creative activity not unlike creative practices in music and art. In other cases, design can be a purely problem solving activity, not unlike research in engineering and industrial production. In its seventh year, University of Michigan Taubman College's Research Through Making (RTM) Program provides seed funding for faculty research, worked on by faculty, students and interdisciplinary experts. The exhibition presents tangible results of their collaborative work. Presentation of projects will start at 6:00pm in the Art & Architecture Building Auditorium, with a reception to follow at the Liberty Annex. Research Through Making Installations: “Domestic Visitors,” Adam Fure “Panots & Mosiacs: The Plasticity of Hydraulic Cement through Making,” Ana Morcillo Pallares “Dip and Dive in the D,” Claudia Wigger “Soundspheres,” Geoff Thun “Post Rock,” Meredith Miller and Thom Moran ​This exhibition runs from March 10 - April 15.

It is a response to world events and contemporary society. The author covers the rise of fundamentalism in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. She describes how increasing western materialism seems to push fundamentalism to greater excesses and she believes the way to coexist is to understand each other’s pain and perceptions.

33476,Economic History,"Abstract: In the four months following the trough of the Great Depression in March 1933, industrial production rose 57 percent. We argue that an important channel aiding recovery came through the direct effect of devaluation on farm prices, incomes, and consumption. We call this the farm channel. Using U.S. and British crop price data, we document that devaluation raised prices of traded crops and their close substitutes (other grains). And using state and county auto sales and income data, we document that recovery proceeded much more rapidly in farm areas. Our baseline estimates imply that a one standard deviation increase in the share of a state’s population living on farms is associated with a 20–34 percentage point increase in auto sales growth from winter to fall 1933. This effect is concentrated in states producing traded crops (cotton, tobacco, wheat) or close substitutes, suggesting an important role for devaluation. In annual county data we show that the farm channel is strongest in counties with more indebted farmers. To map these cross-sectional estimates into an aggregate effect, we build an incomplete-markets model that explicitly incorporates both the benefits of the farm channel to farmers (higher farm income) as well as the costs to nonfarmers (higher prices paid for farm goods). The model suggests that by redistributing income to indebted farmers with a high marginal propensity to consume, the farm channel may explain 25-50% of the spring 1933 recovery.",Map Lorch Hall - 201,['2016-11-01 14:30'],"['Economics', 'History', 'Seminar']",

39290,"Opening Reception for Tracey Snelling exhibition, ""Here and There""","Join us immediately following Tracey Snelling's Stamps lecture for an opening reception with the artist. About the exhibition and artist: ""Here and There"" examines the similarities, differences, and struggles that exist in the US as well as abroad. With nearly half the world's population living in poverty, and over 1.5 billion people living in extreme poverty, this continues to be one of the main challenges of our time. With my installation One Thousand Shacks, I look at the problems of extreme poverty, as well as the strength, tenacity, and ingenuity that is demonstrated in the struggle to survive. New works will examine these issues in the US, how they relate to location and, at times, the disenfranchisement of large groups of people for the sake of big business, political clout, and power. Bio: Through the use of sculpture, photography, video, and large-scale installation, Tracey Snelling gives her impression of a place, its people and their experience. Often, the cinematic image stands in for real life as it plays out behind windows in the buildings, sometimes creating a sense of mystery, other times stressing the mundane. Snelling’s work derives from voyeurism, film noir, and geographical and architectural location. Within this idea of location, themes develop that transport observation into the realm of storytelling, with reality and sociological study being the focus. Snelling had exhibited in international galleries, museums and institutions, including the The Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Belgium; Palazzo Reale, Milan; Museum of Arts and Design, New York; Kunstmuseen Krefeld Germany; El Museo de Arte de Banco de la Republica, Bogota; the Stenersen Museet, Oslo, and the Sundance Film Festival. Her short films have screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival, the Thessaloniki International Film Festival, Circuito Off in Venice, Italy, and the Arquiteturas Film Festival Lisboa in Portugal. She also received a 2015 Joan Mitchell Painters and Sculptors Grant. Snelling lives and works in Oakland, California and Berlin, Germany.",Map 202 S.

13580,Blackthorn,"Blackthorn has been offering their uniquely rich tapestry of Celtic music around the Great Lakes since 1984. Traditional songs of emigration, sea shanties, lively jigs and reels, and haunting ancient airs combine with some of Ireland's best contemporary songs for a musical experience that evokes the beauty, history, and legend of Ireland and its people. Each member of the band plays multiple instruments, including wooden flute, accordion, tin whistle, five-string banjo, cittern, bones and more. These instruments complement the lead vocal of Belfast native Richard McMullan and the band's tight four-part harmonies. Based in Detroit, Blackthorn can usually be found at O'Mara's Pub and Restaurant in Berkley, and their appearances on WJR's St. Patrick's Day show are a Michigan Celtic tradition. This evening they lend their talents in support of ACS CAN-- the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.

33325,STS Speaker: Toward Anti-Ontology: The Unmaking of Chronic Pain in Thailand,"In this talk, I examine a Thai physician’s claim that “there is no chronic pain in Thailand,” and that “chronic pain is a Western invention.” Recent work in ontology has argued that diseases and disease categories are “enacted,” made iteratively by practices in context. In this talk, I will attempt an explanation of the opposite phenomenon: the active “unmaking” of (potential) disease, both as epistemological category and lived experience. I take my Thai physician’s claim in a slightly less positivist direction, and rather than argue that “there is no chronic pain in Thailand,” I will argue that chronic pain is instead actively “un-made” in Thailand. I will share how this process works: that it is unequal, tied to a class politics of suffering; that it is material, tied to the hospital as an organizing place; that it is spiritual, based on a Buddhist model of the human mind and how to intervene upon it; that it is political, emerging from the violent history of opium; and that it is ultimately unstable, as cracks slowly begin to form in the structures that keep chronic pain from becoming a “thing” in Thailand. To make these claims, I will share the stories of a series of Thai elders, some in the process of dying, others enduring chronic suffering, all caught in a web of the making and unmaking of pain.",Map Tisch Hall - 1014,['2016-12-05 16:00'],"['Asia', 'International', 'Medicine', 'Public health', 'Science']",

""Public health efforts promote the first 1000 days of life as influential for health and well-being across the lifespan. This developmental period has both vulnerability and opportunity for the integration of infant physical, behavioral, and microbial systems. Previous research effort has prioritized investigating physiological investment before birth and behavioral care during infancy, but milk production extends physiological investment for the neonate among mammals. Breast milk nourishes, protects, and informs the developing neonate through nutrients, defenses, and hormones. Unlike adults in Westernized, Educated, Industrial, Rich, Democratic nations, far removed from the ancestral conditions that shaped our bodies, the breastfed infant develops within an “adaptively relevant environment.” Cross-cultural investigations combined with an evolutionary viewpoint yield new perspectives of mothers, milk, and infants. Biological and social scientific research on this topic can directly translate to more personalized clinical recommendations and health optimization for mothers and their infants as well as substantiate the importance of infrastructure and institutional support for breastfeeding. Further, a better understanding of the composition and function of milk informs the composition of a more representative artificial substitutes for those mothers facing obstacles or contraindications to breastfeeding. Lastly, decoding mother’s milk will allow for enhanced precision medicine for the most fragile infants and children in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. Transdisciplinary approaches to mother’s milk research, along with public engagement, facilitate discoveries at the bench and their translation to applications at the bedside.""",Map East Hall - 4448,['2016-09-16 15:00'],"['Aem featured', 'Anthropology']",

30484,Nitrene and Carbene Chemistry at Middle and Late First-Row Metals in Bis(alkoxide) Ligand Environments,"Our research focuses on the design of reactive metal centers for N-N, C-N, and C-C bond formation. Toward this goal, we developed a series of new middle and late first-row transition metal complexes in bis(alkoxide) ligand environment and are currently exploring their reactivity in nitrene and carbene transfer. We have recently reported synthesis of “quasi-two-coordinate” complexes M(OR)2(THF)2 (OR = OC(tBu)2Ph, M = Mn, Fe, Co) that proceeds via cluster intermediates featuring rare seesaw geometry. The iron(II) complex Fe(OR)2(THF)2 undergoes facile reaction with aliphatic and aromatic azides. The reaction with aliphatic azides results in the reductive coupling of azides to form the iron(III) hexazene complex (RO)2Fe(μ-κ2:κ2-RN6R)Fe(OR)2. In contrast, the reaction of Fe(OR)2(THF)2 with aromatic azides (ArN3) leads to the formation of azoarenes ArNNAr, with concomitant liberation of dinitrogen. The reaction is catalytic for bulky azides, and is postulated to proceed via metal-nitrene intermediate [Fe(OR)2(NAr)]. Mechanistic, spectroscopic, structural, and theoretical studies will be presented. For chromium, stable Cr(OR)2(NAr) complexes are obtained, which display catalytic reactivity in nitrene transfer to isocyanides. We will also describe our most recent results concerning synthesis, characterization, and reactivity of the formally Co(IV)-carbene complex.

27661,Senecan Rectitude: Bending the Rules,"Victoria Rimell, University of Warwick This paper takes as its stimulus Adriana Cavarero’s critical investigation of rectitude in the Western philosophical tradition (Inclinazioni, 2014) and the notable absence of Seneca (who extensively develops ‘rectitude as a general principle’ Veyne 2012) in her account. My aim here is twofold: to uncover what might be lost in this elision, and to develop understanding – via close readings that are attuned to the challenge of Senecan philosophy as literary performance - of how the gendered ontology of rectitude is increasingly put under pressure and transformed in Seneca’s later philosophical texts. Particular attention will be given to the relationship between form and content in the Letters, and to the question – taken as a serious one, rather than as a response to a ‘contradiction’ which invalidates Senecan thinking and marks it as ‘crooked’ – of how to square Seneca as a thinker of being as a process or un unfolding in time through the medium of the epistle, with the writer who posits a spatialising metaphysic of static impermeability. I argue that the current critical status quo which envisages an unproblematic sacrifice in Seneca of the bodily integrity and verticality constitutive of the Roman male subject in exchange for the consolation of psychic fortitude suppresses the struggle out of which a context-specific praxis of psychic resilience emerges in the Letters, and underestimates both the provocations of this praxis and its philosophical impact. Seneca’s ‘low’ or ‘stooped’ voice (submissiore lingua, Ep.13.4) lures us down from the Platonic-Lucretian citadel of sapientia to a horizontal plain on which the subject must wrestle with, accept, and redefine dangerous leaning as a condition of an ethical life-in-time. The result is a distinctively different geometry, which does not intersect comfortably with normative Roman masculinity or with the ‘straight’ Seneca of our philosophical tradition.",Map Angell Hall - 2175 Classics Library,['2016-02-09 16:00'],['Classical studies'],
17218,Carolina Chocolate Drops,"With their 2010 Nonesuch-label debut, ""Genuine Negro Jig""–which garnered a Best Traditional Folk Album Grammy–The Carolina Chocolate Drops proved that the old-time, fiddle and banjo-based music they’d so scrupulously researched and passionately performed could be a living, breathing, ever-evolving sound. Starting with material culled from the Piedmont region of the Carolinas, they have sought to highlight the central role African Americans have played in shaping our nation’s popular music from its beginnings. The Drops' repertoire incorporates blues, jazz and folk balladry alongside crackling string-band tunes. Though often striking out in new directions, the Drops return to familiar turf with tracks like “Riro’s House,” a traditional piece they’d learned from their late mentor, North Carolina fiddler Joe Thompson. Through several changes in membership, the Drops have continued to prosper under the leadership of singer/fiddler/multi-instrumentalist Rhiannon Giddens, whom super-producer T-Bone Burnett recently called the most profound musician active today. Much more than simply revivalists, The Carolina Chocolate Drops have evolved into American tradition-bearers of the first order–and their show is as much fun as anybody else's in the business.","Off Campus Location - The Ark, 316 S.

The project works at a unique intersection of African American Studies, Art History, and Slavic Studies to explore the enduring power of these Black Sea-related photographs of Circassia. These “thought pictures” about race as Frederick Douglass might have called them underscore the tenuousness, a nervousness even at the heart of the racial project throughout the twentieth century.

In fact, I argue that people largely fail to recognize the borderline where their knowledge ends and their ignorance begins, nor the scope of that ignorance. In essence, the landscape of their ignorance remains largely invisible to them. I discuss two general mechanisms that produce this invisibility. First, people suffer from “unknown unknowns,” ideas and issues so unknown that the person has no awareness that they exist. Second, people suffer from everyday paralogia, or rather faulty reasoning that leads them to erroneous answers to questions that are confidently held. Along the way, I discuss how this analysis related to the phenomenon of hypocognition (i.e., the experience of having no cognitive representation of a concept or idea) and overclaiming (e.g., asserting familiarity with concepts that, in reality, do not exist).",Map East Hall - 4464 East Hall,['2017-01-12 15:00'],['Psychology'],

It turns out that these puzzles, with their three edge labels, connect more directly to Schubert calculus. Last year, Pechenik-Yong and Wheeler--Zinn-Justin used them to compute equivariant K-theory of Grassmannians (using some new pieces). But what about d-step flag manifolds? In 2014, (equivariant) cohomology of 2-step flag manifolds was puzzlified, proving a conjecture of mine from 1999. To force the three sides of a puzzle to relate to the same flag manifold, we assign a vector to each edge label, which leads to vector configurations of 3 vectors (for d=1), 8 for d=2, and 27 for d=3; the configurations correspond to the weights of the minuscule representations of A_2, D_4, and E_6.

28202,Beyond Grice: A socio-pragmatic framework for non-entailed meaning,"Eric Acton (EMU) will present in SoConDi today. The title and abstract of his presentation are given below. Beyond Grice: A socio-pragmatic framework for non-entailed meaning Both Gricean pragmatics and meaning-based sociolinguistics (e.g. Eckert 2008) recognize that non-entailed content is an essential component of linguistic meaning. But despite the productivity and broad coverage of these traditions, both have left a wide range of cases of non-entailed meaning unexplained. The following quote from a 2008 U.S. presidential debate between Barack Obama and John McCain illustrates. (1) MCCAIN: It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate [...] sponsored by Bush and Cheney. You know who voted for it? You might never know. That one [pointing to Obama]. McCain’s use of that one drew extensive negative press, being called, for instance, a “slightly dehumanizing phrase.” Of course, that one doesn’t entail that a speaker uttering the phrase views the intended referent as contemptible or subhuman. Existing approaches to non-entailed content, however, leave (1) and a vast array of related examples unexplained. I present a socio-pragmatic framework for non-entailed content that addresses this gap, built around three key principles: (2) a. Utterances violating conversational expectations are especially likely to be ascribed special significance. b. The full significance of an utterance depends upon context and what makes it distinctive relative to contextually relevant alternatives. c. The weight of a given alternative in determining an utterance u’s full significance varies directly with how well it accords with conversational expectations and how closely related it is to u. As I will show, this framework retains the insights of Gricean pragmatics and meaning-based sociolinguistics while bridging and expanding their empirical reach.",Map Lorch Hall - 473,['2016-01-29 15:00'],"['Discussion', 'Language']",

In fact, those revolutions led to a new kind of open electoral process in which many political actors across the spectrum have played a key role.

36604,CRF regulation of striatal dopamine release and its role in motivated behaviors,"Major depressive disorder as well as other neuropsychiatric diseases are characterized by a pathological shift in stress responsivity. For example, depressed individuals are more likely to withdraw from the environment and respond to acute mild stressors with avoidance while, for healthy individuals, acute mild stressors often serve as motivators and drive engagement. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which acute stressors motivate or demotivate individuals under different conditions is key to understanding the etiology of depression. The stress-associated neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) as well as its two receptors CRF-type 1 and CRF-type 2 are widely distributed throughout central nervous system. Systemic administration of CRF produces avoidance behaviors as well as cognitive impairment. However, it was recently shown that CRF acting in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) potentiates dopamine release to promote approach behavior such as exploration of a novel object. Interestingly, repeated stress disrupts CRF’s ability to increase dopamine and switches the behavioral response to CRF from approach to avoidance. Since this original finding, I have delved further into the mechanism by which CRF increases dopamine release within the NAc in an effort to uncover how this behavioral switch occurs. I have found that that there are two components driving the CRF mediated potentiation of dopamine transients – muscarinic acetylcholine 5 (M5) receptor dependent and independent components. Moreover, I have found that following repeated stressor exposure the M5 dependent component remains intact, while the M5-independent component is disrupted. These data indicate that the M5 receptor could have potential therapeutic potential in treating aberrant striatum-dependent behaviors that emerge following repeated stressor exposure.",Map East Hall - 4448,['2017-01-17 12:00'],['Psychology'],
35124,Bureaucratics exhibition by Jan Banning,"A series of photographs by Dutch photographer Jan Banning documenting offices in different bureaucracies around the world. Ten photographs will be displayed at the Institute for the Humanities and 40 at the Duderstadt Gallery. Artist's Statement: Bureaucratics is a project consisting of a book and a traveling exhibition that has so far been shown in museums and galleries in some twenty countries on five continents. The book and the exhibition contain 50 photographs and are the product of an anarchist’s heart, a historian’s mind and an artist’s eye. Bureaucratics is a comparative photographic study of the culture, rituals and symbols of state civil administrations and its servants in eight countries on five continents, selected on the basis of political, historical and cultural considerations: Bolivia, China, France, India, Liberia, Russia, the United States, and Yemen. In each country, I visited up to hundreds of offices of members of the executive in different services and at different levels. The visits were unannounced and the accompanying writer, Will Tinnemans*, by interviewing kept the employees from tidying up or clearing the office. That way, the photos show what a local citizen would be confronted with when entering. The photography has a conceptual, typological approach reminding of August Sander’s ‘Menschen des 20 Jahrhunderts’ (‘People of the Twentieth Century’). Each subject is posed behind his or her desk. The photos all have a square format (fitting the subject), are shot from the same height (that of the client), with the desk – its front or side photographed parallel to the horizontal edges of the frame – serving as a bulwark protecting the representative of rule and regulation against the individual citizen, the warm-blooded exception. They are full of telling details that sometimes reveal the way the state proclaims its power or the bureaucrat’s rank and function, sometimes of a more private character and are accompanied by information such as name, age, function and salary. Though there is a high degree of humour and absurdity in these photos, they also show compassion with the inhabitants of the state’s paper labyrinth. -Jan Banning",Map Duderstadt Center (Media Union) - Gallery,"['2016-10-17 12:00', '2016-10-18 12:00', '2016-10-19 12:00', '2016-10-20 12:00', '2016-10-21 12:00', '2016-10-24 12:00', '2016-10-25 12:00', '2016-10-26 12:00', '2016-10-27 12:00', '2016-10-28 12:00']","['Art', 'Exhibition', 'International', 'Multicultural', 'Visual arts']",
15658,EEB Thursday Seminar Series,"The outcome of infection with the amphibian chytrid fungus (Bd = Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis), can vary greatly between amphibian species, and in some cases between populations of the same species. In some amphibians, infection with Bd can lead to the disease chytridiomycosis, death of individuals, and declines and extirpation at the population level. Other amphibians, however, can become infected with Bd without experiencing negative effects at either the individual or population level. In California’s Sierra Nevada, both of these outcomes of Bd infection are occurring in populations of the mountain yellow-legged frog species complex (Rana muscosa & Rana sierrae): chytridiomycosis has led to the extirpation of mountain yellow-legged frogs from hundreds of lakes, while infected populations of the same species have persisted in other lakes for many years despite high Bd prevalence. Efforts are currently underway, both in the Sierra Nevada and worldwide, to attempt to control this pathogen and/or limit its impact on amphibian populations. Eradication of Bd is highly unlikely, therefore understanding the mechanisms that allow amphibian populations to persist with Bd is important for conservation efforts. In this talk, I will investigate which of the available control strategies have the greatest potential to protect amphibian populations from extinctions.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1210,['2013-12-05 16:00'],"['Ecology', 'Evolutionary biology']",

A performer with an abiding love of being in front of an audience, Rush is a rib-tickling storyteller, an expressive singer, and a guitarist capable of real melancholy. He's an Ark favorite, and, says the Chicago Tribune, he's ""probably the only man alive who should be allowed to sing Joni Mitchell songs."" Tom Rush is, in short, folk royalty.

20258,CREES Noon Lecture,"Speaker: Jeanne Kormina, professor of anthropology and religious studies, Higher School of Economics, St. Petersburg After the death of the Soviet Union, former Soviet citizens started to develop new national identities. In Russia there was already language to articulate an idea of belonging to the new state. The Russian Orthodox Church had articulated for ages a religiously-inspired, elaborate narrative of Russianness. As a result, the secular state started using religious symbols, such as saints and icons, to communicate with its very secular citizens, particularly concerning the most sensitive topics. Similarly, in their everyday lives Russian citizens often articulate their banal nationalism using the same religious language. How to build a genealogy of the nation? How to deal with the Soviet past? Which land is ours? Who are our enemies and why do they treat us so badly? In the search to find answers to these and similar questions, many Russian people today turn to the religious vocabulary of Russian Orthodox Christianity. In my talk I will focus of veneration of martyrs in Russia. I will demonstrate how analysis of popular veneration of the Emperor Nikolay II, new martyrs, and a hero of the Chechen war, Evgeny Rodionov, help us to understand some important features of the popular political imagination in contemporary Russia. Jeanne Kormina is professor of anthropology and religious studies in the Department of Sociology, Higher School of Economics (St Petersburg, Russia). Her books in Russian include a monograph Rituals of Departure to the Military Service in Late Imperial Russia (2005) and co-edited volumes Dreams of the Mother of God (2006) and Invention of Religion in Post-Soviet Russia (forthcoming).
