After their plane crashes, Phyllis, and her son, Bishop, are stranded on a desert island for five years. During their stay, Bishop is transformed from a stuttering, Katherine Hepburn-obsessed little boy, in to a feral savage. Phyllis devolves from a glib, callused sophisticate to a helpless, addled shell. Left to fend for themselves, they dine on the bodies of the dead passengers and eventually become lovers. At home, we see Howard, Phyllis' husband and famous movie director, continuing life with his somewhat loopy, ex-porn-star mistress, Pam. Pam moves in with Howard and becomes pregnant. Bishop remembers his mother's recurring dream about a three-hundred-pound transvestite. This monstrosity multiplied in her dreams and became several fat men in skirts, in cages. It is the acceptance of this memory that may allow Bishop to heal, moving forward and understanding the relationship between love and harm.",Map Walgreen Drama Center - Studio 1,"['2011-03-24 19:00', '2011-03-25 19:00', '2011-03-25 23:00', '2011-03-26 19:00']","['Basement arts', 'Fat men', 'Fat men in skirts', 'Free theater', 'Literary', 'Lou', 'Lou king', 'Michigan theater', 'Musical theater', 'Musket', 'Nicky silver', 'Psychology', 'Rude mechanicals', 'Student org', 'Studio 1', 'Theater', 'Visual arts', 'Walgreen drama center']"

A remarkable example of this problem lies in the cost of mitigating weedy plant infestations in agricultural crops–an estimated $37B of the US economy is lost yearly due to crop damage and the cost of herbicide application (Pimental 2005). Despite the impact of weedy plants on the world’s food supply, little is known about the evolutionary potential of traits that make a plant a weed, and less is understood about the genetics of plant ”˜weediness.’ Dr. Baucom's research makes use of manipulative field experiments and publicly available data sets, as well as the tools of quantitative genetics, bioinformatics and molecular biology to assess how plants adapt to human-mediated selection and which plant species are likely to adapt. She focuses on weeds and domesticated species of the model genus Ipomoea (morning glories) to address a range of key evolutionary and ecological questions that will ultimately inform components of agricultural food production.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1210,['2012-11-08 16:00'],"['Ecology', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Sustainable food systems']"
11173,EEB Seminar Series - Special Day!,"Recent studies suggest that climatic changes can disrupt predator communities, and may lead to increased pest outbreaks in agricultural fields. Understanding these effects necessitates a mechanistic understanding of both, predator diversity on prey suppression, and the eco-evolutionary response of communities to climatic changes. To compare patterns of predation between simple and diverse communities of aphid predators Dr Tobin used an experimental response-surface design, varying intra- and interspecific predator densities. By statistically fitting mechanistic models to the data, he demonstrated that resource partitioning rather than facilitation better explains the observed differences in resource use between simple and diverse predator communities. This model-fitting approach also allowed him to quantify overlap in resource use by the different predator species. Dr Tobin then theoretically explored the effects of climate change on interacting species. Predicting the consequences of interspecific interactions is complicated by coevolution between species. Therefore, he used simple models to organize and synthesize the ways coevolution modifies species coexistence when climatic changes favour one species over another. In cases where species have conflicting interests, he shows that coevolution reduces the effects of climate change, leading to reduced chances of extinction. Conversely, when species have non-conflicting interests, coevolution increases the effects of climate change, increasing extinction risk. Thus, coevolution sets up feedback loops that either dampen or amplify the effect of climate change on species extinctions, depending on the form that coevolution takes between species. Dr Tobin discusses these results in light of natural pest control in agroecosystems and potential future research evaluating the potential for sustainable food production in a changing climate.",Map Chemistry & Willard H Dow Laboratory - 1200,['2012-11-05 16:00'],"['Ecology', 'Evolutionary biology', 'Sustainable food systems']"

Dr. Fabian will then present a public lecture: ""Feedback from Active Black Holes: How a central black hole can control a galaxy"" All large galaxies appear to have a central black hole with a mass about 0.1% that of the host galaxy. Evidence is growing that the black hole may be the prime mover here, despite the radius of the galaxy being a billion times larger than the radius of the black hole. The key point is the enormous quantity of energy produced by matter accreting onto the black hole. At times this makes the galaxy nucleus active and cause energy to be fed back into the galaxy to push and heat its gas clouds. How these processes operate and how the energy interacts with the gas will be discussed and illustrated with images from the radio through X-ray wavebands. Dr. Andrew Fabian is a Royal Society Research Professor at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge. He has served as President of the Royal Astronomical Society and is Vice Master of Darwin College, Cambridge. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society, has been awarded an Order of the British Empire, won the Rossi Prize in 2001, and the Dannie Heineman Prize in 2008. His research interests include black holes, clusters of galaxies, and X-ray astronomy. Orren C Mohler was chairman of the Department of Astronomy and director of the observatories from 1962 - 1970.

It also promotes greater diversity in leadership in the environmental field. Her lecture is titled ""Race, Poverty, and Access to Food in America: Resistance, Survival, and Sustainability."" It begins at 5 p.m. in Room 1040, Dana Building. The lecture will be followed by a question-and-answer session and is open to the public. Her research interests include urban agriculture and food security; green jobs; social movement analysis; environmental justice; leisure and natural resource use; poverty; and race, gender, and ethnic relations. Taylor is the principal investigator on a five-year, $4 million study of disparities in access to healthy food across the state. The researchers will interview residents and study data in 18 small to mid-sized cities to better understand the factors affecting ""food security,"" a socioeconomic term that defines easy access to safe and healthy food. And because urban agriculture is seen as part of the solution to food insecurity in cities, the researchers will study how locally grown food can more easily get to the poor, traditionally minority, populations most at risk. ""The study will give us an opportunity to get an in-depth understanding of several types of food systems in the state,"" Taylor said. ""The study is unique in that we will examine aspects of the food system that are necessary to connect food to consumers more efficiently."" Other recent research activities have included an analysis of the green jobs sector and four national studies of racial and gender diversity in the environmental field. Her 2009 book, ""The Environment and the People in American Cities,"" is an award-winning urban environmental history book. In 2010, she completed an edited volume titled, ""Environment and Social Justice: An International Perspective."" And she just completed a book to be published in 2013 titled, ""Why Don’t They Move?

12443,The Rebel Farmer Returns,"World-renowned farmer and permaculture master Sepp Holzer visits SE Michigan this April for an incredible three-day, hands-on installation course, as well as a public lecture at the University of Michigan. Sepp Holzer has pioneered the use of ecological farming and permaculture throughout the world, practices that help to counter modern agricultural crises such as drought, pesticide pollution, loss of biodiversity and soil erosion. Sepp began farming this way in Austria in the 1960s after being unsuccessful with conventional agriculture methods. He is known as the ""rebel farmer"" because he persisted in these practices despite being fined and even threatened with prison. His working farm in the Austrian Alps receives thousands of students and visitors each year. Holzer Permaculture is a natural form of agriculture, based on the cycles and interactions found in nature. In addition to farming, animal husbandry, fruit growing, aquaculture, horticulture, and agroforestry, Sepp works to regenerate and remediate damaged landscapes. This includes the building of terraces, raised beds, water gardens, soil reservoirs, wet biomes and ponds in order to create resilient ecosystems and microclimates. These strategies have proven that working in harmony with nature is not only ecologically sound, but can also be economically successful. ""Learn to speak with Nature. Learn to assess her accurately. Ask yourself what she offers you. Those who learn to observe will identify niches in production and in all areas of farming, making it possible for a good living."" – Sepp Holzer In May of 2012, Sepp made his first ever visit to the Midwest for a hands-on installation course at Detroit’s Catherine Ferguson Academy. Students worked with Sepp to install one of his signature ""kratergartens” – gardens or small-scale farms built upon a substructure of craters and mounds – and the results were nothing short of astonishing. The upcoming three-day course will provide another opportunity to travel and work with Holzer – this time to create TWO of his signature permaculture installations, in Ypsilanti and Highland Park. The events this April, 2013 include: Public lecture by Sepp at The Rackham Amphitheatre, University of Michigan (Rackham Building, 4th floor), Tuesday, April 2nd, 6:30 – 9:00 pm – open to the public 3-day installation course, April 2nd – 4th (in Ann Arbor, Highland Park and Ypsilanti) – space for 40 registered participants only.

13291,Northern Michigan Landscapes Exhibit,"Visit the Pierpont Commons Wall Gallery located just outside of the Commons Cafe to see this beautiful exhibit! Artist: Rachael Van Dyke Artist Statement - Northern Michigan Landscapes Growing up in a large Italian family where emotions and energy were high, everything had to be done fast. I showered fast, ate fast, talked fast, walked fast and made things fast. Early on I learned to create quickly, having to finish my projects in a matter of hours. I learned to work collaboratively and to not become too attached to my work. This childhood dynamic created a need in me to be aggressive in my work, often cutting through the paint surfaces and restating my lines. Whether I am exploring portraits or landscapes I want my materials to be bold and work fast with me. Exposing that energetic style through a variety of mark making and under-drawing is important to me as it reflects my own zeal for life. I find myself most comfortable when away from the tradition of easel and canvas. I am often on my hands and knees actively engaged with the drawing, my feet thick in charcoal and oil bar. Outdoors, I tape charcoal onto the tip of a 3-foot stick to use as my drawing tool. Using these techniques allow for a more natural, spontaneous, and spirited drawing. I am eager to search for shapes of color and light that fall on the planes of the face and the ridge and valleys of land. These organic movements are revealed in my landscape paintings, through juxtaposing patterns and colors of the farmlands and vineyards of Upstate New York and Northern Michigan. The exhibit will be displayed through Thursday, May 16th. All pieces in the exhibit are for sale.

The changing political economy of food production and consumption and its role in reshaping social identities and agrarian environments remains remarkably understudied. This lecture outlines the preliminary contours of a project that attempts to analyze some of these shifts through a selective discussion of changing food practices in post-Independence western India. It delineates the widening circuits of food as a commodity form within the home and outside, spanned by the growth of processed foods and practices of 'eating out'. It outlines the changing signification of food practices for different social groups, and considers some potential health and ecological implications arising from the transformation. It makes the case for focused attention on food as a way of understanding social change in India.",Map School of Social Work Building - 1644,['2013-09-17 16:00'],"['Food', 'India', 'Sociology']"
14508,The Choice of Heterosexuality: The Porn Industry in France (1975-2010),"In the middle of the 1970s, the porn industry emerged in France, tolerated by a liberal government and regulated by new legal provisions. Since then, French pornographers have presented themselves as fantasy entrepreneurs: in their view, their professional role is to capture and respond to consumers’ various desires. This largely male-dominated trade has a gendered and sexual organization: women are excluded from the market, and there is a clear split in the industry between gay and straight porn. Although pornographers present this divide as being obvious, Dr. Trachman argues that it must be seen as a choice. As “lesbian” scenes in straight porn show, this exclusion concerns only male homosexuality.

17871,Sports and the University,"Sport is deeply interwoven with institutions of higher education in America today. Sports—as intramural and intercollegiate activities for students, as a segment of the entertainment industry within American society, as cultural objects of intense popular interest and media coverage, and as research subjects for faculty and students in a varied and expanding range of disciplines, whether at major public research institutions or small, private liberal arts colleges—are indisputably a central aspect of the landscape of American higher education. The value of sport in the university context, however, is not beyond dispute.On the contrary, as sports play an ever greater role in higher education and in American society, debates have arisen, on the pages of daily newspapers and specialized academic journals, about their role and the costs and benefits they carry—from financial to educational, physical to cultural to moral. These questions, furthermore, intersect in complex ways with broader social issues related to gender, race, and sexual orientation, and the symposium will seek to shed light on the ways in which approaches to and assessments of the question of value change when these factors are taken into account.

17957,Globalized Local Sounds,"“World music”, which appeared in the West in the 1980s as a marketing/classificatory device of the music industry, usually refers to non-Western music or fusion of Western and non-Western music. The all-inclusive concept becomes even more ambiguous when it is adopted into the Chinese language. However, more and more Chinese musicians are making use of the term to promote their music to a wider audience, both nationally and internationally. Ethnic minority musicians find this new market of “world music” useful to sell their marginalized music. Han Chinese musicians are also inspired by “world music” to draw from their traditions and mix it with other music languages. For the Shanghai government, “world music” is in accordance with its imaging of the city’s position as an international metropolis. Thus it sponsored the World Music Shanghai, China’s first world music festival, as one of the events to celebrate the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. A number of other world music festivals have been born in China since then, often with the sponsorship of real estate companies, who do so to promote their brands. What does “world music” mean in the Chinese context? Mr. Mu Qian is a Chinese performing arts curator, ethnomusicologist, and writer. He received his M.A. in Ethnomusicology from the China Conservatory in 2005, and B.A. in English Language and Literature from Nanjing University in 1997.Mu has served as Music Director of World Music Shanghai and MOMA Post Mountain Music-Art Festival in Beijing, two festivals dedicated to introducing music from around the world to the Chinese audience as well as presenting Chinese music with a global perspective. Mu has recently received a fellowship of the Asian Cultural Council to do research on world music and observe arts administration practices in Washington D.C. and New York from March to October 2014.",Map Michigan Union - Pond Room,['2014-09-17 12:00'],"['Chinese studies', 'Free', 'Multicultural', 'Music']"
17958,The Linguistics of Music,"Can music be analyzed rigorously and studied linguistically? This presentation demonstrates that, whilst music as a sensory-perceptual experience cannot be analyzed via linguistic means, aesthetic and cultural concepts written about music can. In Western music, composers have generally continued the tradition of “describing” how their works should be performed, engaging in the use of musical terms such as affettuoso (‘tenderly’ in Italian), etc. Chinese musical concepts present a compelling focal point of study since many have been in use for several millennia. These concepts not only provide a window through which to tap into Chinese music, they are also “cultural key words…which reflect the core values” of Chinese culture (following Wierzbicka 1991: 333). As our linguistic tool for analysis, this study adopts the Natural Semantic Metalanguage, as advanced by Wierzbicka and Goddard. Analyzed meanings of selected Chinese musical concepts illustrate how, why and in what respects these concepts attest to important aesthetic and cultural values in Chinese. Adrian Tien is an assistant professor in the Department of Chinese Studies, National University of Singapore. His teaching and research interests include linguistics, specializing in the areas of semantics, language and culture, cross-cultural communication, language acquisition, translation and language and music. Dr. Tien is also trained as a musicologist and is a sought-after musician (pianist and carillonneur), being a prizewinner of several international music competitions.

17959,New Sounds of Ancient Music,"In this lecture, Professor Ye Guohui of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music discusses his interpretations of historical Chinese music and culture, and shows how he expressed ancient music scenes in his compositions. Specifically, he will discuss his musical rendition of Gu Hong’s (937-975) Night Revels of Han Xizai, a masterpiece of Chinese painting, which vividly portrays five women playing music over a thousand years ago. Dr. Ye Guohui is a composer, professor and chair of the Composition Department of Shanghai Conservatory of Music. His compositions have been acknowledged in numerous prestigious competitions and music awards. Most notably, his ""Late Autumn for Orchestra"" won the European Composer Award in 2007, after which he was commissioned to compose the festival hymn ""Echo"" for Young Euro Classic 2008. This award winning piece was performed by the participating orchestras from all over the world and was highly praised as ""fanfare from China"" by European media. His representative works include ""Sound Space II"" for Erhu , ""Early Spring"" for female chorus, ""Sunset in Yangguan"" and ""A cappella II"" for chamber music, ""To Mozart"" for cello concerto, ""Listening to Jiangnan"" for Pipa and grand Chinese orchestra, and lastly for symphonic chorus.

17960,Why Is Chinese So Redundant?,"The eminent sinologist Bernhard Karlgren (1918) observed an unusual property of Chinese: Many Chinese words seem quite redundant, such as kan-jian ‘(look)-see’, xie-zi ‘write-(words)’, hui-dao ‘return-(reach)’, and yan-lei ‘(eye)-tear’. The reason, he suggests, is that Chinese has too few syllables and too many homophones, and disyllabic words can avoid ambiguity. This view is accepted widely, both East and West, but with little evidence. This lecture will show that, despite its plausibility, the orthodox is wrong. San Duanmu is Professor of Linguistics at the University of Michigan. He received his PhD in Linguistics from MIT in 1990 and has held teaching posts at Fudan University, Shanghai (1981-1986) and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (1991-present).

17962,Class Education Exhibitions,"During the Mao era, cultural workers in communities all over the People’s Republic of China created political exhibitions. These exhibitions were part of a larger effort to rewrite local experience, and the local landscape, in the universal language of Chinese Marxism and in the artistic style of socialist realism. Local exhibitions were one concrete form of cultural work that used tangible local detail—local speech, local diet, local forms of agriculture or industrial production—to show that local lives and local experiences conformed to the truths of Marxism, and to the universal history of the Chinese nation. In Gejiu, a tin-mining town in southern Yunnan, cultural workers in the 1970s created an Exhibition on the History of Class Struggle in the Gejiu Tin Mines and a Recollect Bitterness Center. These joint exhibitions became the premier “classrooms” for class education in Yunnan province, instructing as many as a thousand visitors a day. During the 1950s, cultural workers in Gejiu had authenticated the local truth of Chinese Marxist history by displaying personal stories of capitalist exploitation, rags worn by miners in the inhumane “old society,” and drawings of worker uprisings. The exhibitions they created during the Cultural Revolution added historical reenactment as a new technique of political instruction. Historical reenactment primarily took the form of yiku (“recollecting bitterness”), narratives about oppression and liberation recited by the elderly. The practice of yiku invoked the older, powerful practice of suku (“venting grievances”), a method of class struggle during the land reforms of the 1940s and 1950s. Written renditions and live performances of yiku featured prominently in class education exhibitions, amplified by artwork and the display of pre-liberation artifacts. This historical reenactment enjoined visitors to “learn through experience” (tihui) the exploitation, oppression, revolt, and liberation of the Chinese proletariat. The Recollect Bitterness Center even recreated the very time and space of the narrated events. Crawling through an old mine shaft and emerging upright into the light, visitors to the Center performed the metaphorical choreography of emancipation and its structure of historical memory. This instilment of perceptual knowledge about the nature of classes and the meaning of proletarian revolution produced an embodied understanding of Chinese Marxist history, interpolated new political subjects, and incited socialist construction.

18274,Demonic Soundscapes,"This talk investigates several plays in the Ming court repertoire on the demons Erlang and Nezha, and explores how sensations of sound, smell, and sight define natural communities of demons that are place specific, and how these same perceptual sensations signal the crossing of boundaries that are meant to segregate demons and grant them territorial autonomy. The processes of quelling of these aggressive demons have a historical lineage in folk myth and local cults, and the plays reflect the ways in which the Chinese state controlled local cults by incorporating them into state-sanctioned religious ritual, and appropriating their local power for state interests. Stephen West is a Foundation Professor of Chinese at Arizona State University and professor emeritus in the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at the University of California, Berkeley. His original research interests are in Chinese performance literature and cultural history of the 11th-14th century. While these may not seem particularly “global” in nature, in fact many of the features considered to be marks of modernity appear in Chinese society at this time as features of a society undergoing rapid urbanization, an explosion of print media, and a rapid change in the nature of its governing class. His work has centered on texts from popular culture.",Map Michigan League - Henderson Room (3rd floor),['2014-11-20 16:00'],"['Chinese studies', 'Culture', 'Free', 'History']"

18327,Pan Gongkai: Melt,"Pan Gongkai’s Melt (潘公凯：融) is a large-scale video installation that is concerned with the relationship between Chinese and Western art forms. Projected on the screen are images of withered lotuses gradually being covered by snow. The lotuses are derived from one of Pan’s large ink paintings, while the snow is composed with the words from the artist’s theoretical text, “On the Boundary of Western Modern Art.” The composition reflects Pan’s concern for the ways in which modern Western art has imposed itself upon traditional Chinese culture. Here, the withered lotuses can be seen as representing traditional Chinese literati culture, while the snow can be understood as part of a forced dialogue with the West. Although the snow might be viewed as threatening to blot out China’s artistic traditions, it can also be seen as the element of its regeneration. After all, it is this same snow that, when melted, nourishes future blossoms. Melt (or Snow Melt) was featured at the Chinese Pavilion of 54th Venice Biennale (2011). This presentation is cosponsored by the Penny W. Stamps School of Art and Design at U-M.",Map Work Gallery 306 South State Street,['2014-09-12 12:00'],"['Chinese studies', 'Exhibition', 'Free', 'Visual arts']"
18328,Ink Painting as Case Study,"Interest in new ink—ink painting which combines new techniques with traditional influences—is on the rise in China and internationally. This is true from both a craft perspective, as a study of methodology, and from that of museums looking to feature installations and establish collections. This trend developed as scholars of traditional ink painting, and artists who work in the medium, have been forced to confront the question of whether the form remains relevant and retains the persuasive artistic power it has traditionally held, or whether it must become more reflective of the contemporary. Before answering this question, it is important to develop an ontological discourse on the tradition of painting in ink—to determine the core essence of the form in order to understand the ways in which its elements may be combined with contemporary techniques. What are we talking about when we discuss ink painting? Ink and rice paper as materials? The blackness of ink as a color? The brush as a strange tool? In contrasting various arguments, it becomes clear that the existing discourse on ink painting, in presuming the tradition a virtue, over-evaluates its specialties and advantages in style, and in its use of material and the tools employed. There is little basis for the assumption by devotees of the form that the techniques and material used in ink painting are superior to oil and canvas. Instead, the true essence of ink painting, and its strength as a medium, comes from the spirituality of the literati ink painting tradition, in which artists produce work with the aim of reflecting the ideal values of a community, rather than to produce a physical object of value. Professor Pan Gongkai will present his art practices in seeking alternative ways of combining the contemporary and the traditional: contemporary installation work with an ink element; a video installation presenting reflections on the aesthetic mechanics of ink painting; and practices developed from the sense of self-discipline which evolved with the tradition. Only the last should be considered new ink, though the first two make for interesting contemporary work. A renowned artist, theoretician and educator, Pan Gongkai is a strong proponent of the Chinese ink painting tradition. His large ink paintings retain essential elements of traditional literati painting enhanced with modern aesthetics. In this way, his work exemplifies a modern synthesis of traditional ink and wash painting. Critically acclaimed, Pan’s ink paintings and installations works have been exhibited at the Paris headquarters of UNESCO, Venice Biennale, ZKM in Germany and major art museums in New York, San Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Macao. He is the author of History of Painting in China, Limit and Exploration, Analysis of Pan Tianshou’s Painting Skill and On Pan Tianshou’s Life and Art. In recent years, Pan has dedicated himself to comprehensive research on modern Chinese art, and his recent publication The Road of Chinese Modern Art has made a significant impact on the liberal arts in China. Pan currently serves as the president of the China Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing.",Map Michigan Union - Pendleton Room (2nd floor),['2014-09-26 16:00'],"['Chinese studies', 'Culture', 'Free', 'Lecture', 'Visual arts']"

18339,Journey to the East,"In the West, we are somewhat familiar with Chinese opera and acrobatic troupes. But what about contemporary Chinese theatre and its makers? How do we access the plays that entertain and touch audiences in the East? And how can we develop further cultural dialogue? This talk will start with an outline of theatre in London and how this has engaged with China. Then the speaker will present a snapshot of the major theatrical centers in mainland China, in Beijing and Shanghai, how they have embraced Western forms, and yet how each city differs in approach. There will also be a look at the theatre of Hong Kong, which is very much a hybrid of East meets West. To aid our understanding, we can explore how the theatre being produced in the East is (and is not) comparable to Broadway, Off-Broadway and the fringe theatre of the West. We will then examine the barriers and opportunities for creating work in China, from cultural contexts to issues of translation, as well as the potential to be able to bring exciting, canonical, modern Chinese plays to the West. Theatre director Jonathan Man, of Hong Kong Chinese descent and born & bred in the U.K., has been working on projects in China and Hong Kong the past three years, and will be sharing his creative journey. He has directed a variety of shows on different scales, including “Monkey!” - based on the classic novel “Journey to the West”, and ""wAve"" - a Korean American re-imagining of the ""Medea"" myth. He is the first British director to have been programmed for the Beijing International Fringe Festival, and he has worked on two Shakespeare productions in Shanghai. He is now looking to create ambitious theatre productions in the U.K. and the U.S. to platform the Chinese contemporary canon, as well as developing innovative theatre for audiences in China & Hong Kong. His work draws from the East and the West, and his cultural background has allowed him to gain a unique insight into the Chinese theatrical landscape.",Map Michigan League - Vandenberg Room (2nd floor),['2014-10-22 12:00'],"['Chinese studies', 'Culture', 'Free', 'Multicultural', 'Theater']"

18436,Exhibition: Suspended Moments: Photographs from the David S. Rosen Collection,"Each of the works in Suspended Moments: Photographs from the David S. Rosen Collection offers insights into an interior world, most glimpsed from the vantage point of a child or young adult. The exhibition—featuring photographs of children at various stages, particularly those difficult years that chart the transition from childhood to adulthood—includes images that were clearly very closely related to the research interests of the collector, Dr. David S. Rosen. Rosen was a physician on the staff of the University of Michigan Medical School, and a pediatrician with a specialization in adolescent medicine. He was a dedicated collector as well as a practicing photographer.

18437,Guided Tour: Fred Tomaselli: The Times,"Even in our digital age of constant information, the rhythmic cycle of the daily newspaper is still a central form of organizing the world around us. The paper’s front page records in the present tense what will eventually become history. It orients our attention to pressing actions, be they individual, political, or natural, that over time repeat and rearrange into patterns around common human motivations. Fred Tomaselli‘s The Times traffics in these patterns, reflecting and reinventing them through complexly layered collages superimposed on recent cover stories in The New York Times. The collages surface unseen connections, rearrange realities, and reveal relationships of images and ideas across time and space. Tomaselli uses images within the familiar grid of the front page as portals, overwriting and manipulating the supposed objective reality of the newspaper with his completely subjective surreality. His interventions play against the detachment of journalistic forms, inserting emotion, fantasy, and absurdity to counterpoint or underscore the original narrative. Tomaselli says these works “freeze time,” trapping inherently ephemeral events and images like flies in amber. But in aggregate this act also reimagines time, linking images and actions of a chosen day to their counterparts in the past and in some projected future. The Times grew from Tomaselli’s own doodlings of personal commentary while reading, eventually spurring him to marry his “news junkie” habit with his studio practice. The series runs the gamut from hard-edged abstraction to hallucinatory pattern play, and engages in a dialogue with art historical imagery and themes, refracted through present-day news images. Lead support for this exhibition is provided by the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment. Additional generous support is provided by the University of Michigan Department of American Culture, Department of the History of Art, Institute for the Humanities, and Penny W.

Through an examination of an array of cultural artifacts such as corridos, TV shows, newspapers, comics, and fiction, as well as academic novels and archival documents, this presentation will traces the apparition of El Chupacabras (1994), or goatsucker, within the context of the dismantling of the welfare state and the anti-immigrants anxieties of the post-cold war years in the United States. In addition, it analyzes the Chupacabras as a subversive image, used to unify and address the struggles of small farmers, as a sophisticated polysemic entity, that illustrates the insatiable “blood sucking” appetite and predatory practices of neo-liberalism as implemented by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the 1990s.",Map Kelsey Museum of Archaeology - 125,['2014-09-16 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Food', 'Free', 'History', 'Lecture', 'Multicultural', 'Reception', 'Social']"

What values or meanings were given voice by this phenomenon? What characterized its artists, opera producers, film practitioners, and critics? One answer can be found in the film operettas that were produced by UFA in Berlin from 1930-33, with their frivolous plots, and their ambiguous reception from the 1930s to the present.",Map Rackham Graduate School (Horace H.) - East Conference Room,['2015-02-23 17:00'],"['Free', 'Music']"

In this talk, Agawu argues that the complexity of African rhythm is a rational complexity based on palpable beats, meter, and periodicity, and that reciprocal patterns of embodiment by dancers reveal its underlying structures.

18613,Exhibition: Paramodel,"This exhibition will present Paramodel, an art collaborative established by two contemporary Japanese artists, Yasuhiko Hayashi (born 1971) and Yûsuke Nakano (born 1976), in Osaka in 2001. Paramodel works in a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, video, and photography, often combining pieces in site-specific installations that seek to construct a parallel world of “play” intersecting with the real world. For UMMA’s exhibition, Paramodel will create a new installation derived from their most famous series, paramodelic-graffiti. In a mesmerizing network of blue-colored model railroads that fill flat surfaces in and beyond the gallery, the installation will transgress the boundaries of space, media, and art production, collapsing the distinction between gallery and street; between two-dimensional drawing and three-dimensional object; and between creator and spectator. The exhibition will create an experience for visitors full of what the team calls “paradoxes.” Though they’ve shown extensively in Asia and Europe over the past ten years, this marks Paramodel’s first solo exhibition of work in the United States.

18614,Exhibition: Amie Siegel: Provenance,"Amie Siegel’s Provenance traces in reverse the global trade in furniture from the Indian city of Chandigarh. Conceived in the 1950s by architects Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, Chandigarh’s controversial modernist architecture includes original pieces of furniture created specifically for the building’s interiors. Recently these pieces have appeared at auction houses around the world, commanding record prices. Starting with Chandigarh furniture in the present, the film begins in New York apartments, London townhouses, Belgian villas, and Paris salons of avid collectors. From there, it moves backward to the furniture’s sale at auction, preview exhibitions, and photography for auction catalogues, to restoration, cargo shipping containers, and Indian ports—ending finally in Chandigarh, a city in a state of entropy. On October 19, 2013, Siegel auctioned Provenance at Christie’s in London, turning the film into another object at auction, inseparable from the market it depicts. Lot 248, a second film, captures the auction of Provenance, becoming a mirror of the first, repeating and completing the circuit of design and art that define speculative markets. Amie Siegel was born in 1974 in Chicago. Her work has been exhibited internationally at MoMA/PS1, Walker Art Center, Hayward Gallery, Whitney Museum of American Art, KW Berlin, ICA Boston, and the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart. Screenings include Cannes Film Festival, Berlin Film Festival, New York Film Festival, The Museum of Modern Art, The National Gallery of Art, and the Harvard Film Archive, among many other museums and cinematheques. She has been a fellow of the DAAD Berliner Künstlerprogramm, the Guggenheim Foundation, and The Film Study Center at Harvard University, as well as a recipient of the ICA Bostonʼs Foster Prize and, most recently, a Sundance Institute Film Fund award for Provenance.

18619,Exhibition: Three Michigan Architects: Part 3—George Brigham,"Three Michigan Architects: Part 3—George Brigham is the last in a series of three consecutive exhibitions. Part 1 of the series presented the work of David Osler (December 21, 2013–March 30, 2014) and Part 2, the work of Robert Metcalf (April 5–July 13, 2014). The series will culminate on October 5, 2014 with a symposium that will explore the importance of this circle of Ann Arbor-based architects, situating their regional body of domestic work into the larger context of modern architecture in the U.S. that developed on the East Coast and West Coast from the 1930s–1980s. Symposium participants include UMMA Director Joseph Rosa, Head of the University Archives Program at the Bentley Historical Library Nancy Bartlett, Bentley Associate Archivist and Head of Digital Curation Services Nancy Deromedi, and Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning faculty Claire Zimmerman, Greg Saldaña, Craig Borum, and Robert Beckley. This exhibition is part of the U-M Collections Collaborations series, which showcases the renowned and diverse collections of the University of Michigan.

18620,Exhibition: Artistic Impositions in the Photographic Portrait,"Susan Sontag claimed that photographs “owe their existence to a loose cooperation (quasi-magical, quasi-accidental) between photographer and subject.” Any photographic portrait marks an encounter between the person executing the image and the person posing for it. The sixteen photographs included in this exhibition speak to an especially charged collaboration between photographer and model in that they are all portraits of artists. When a photographer is faced with a subject who is so thoroughly invested in artistic representation, how might this impact his or her own photographic aesthetic? In this suite of remarkable photographs, we witness different manifestations of this phenomenon at work. For example, we see results ranging from the surreal to the seemingly straightforward through encounters between Salvador Dalí and Philippe Halsman; Frida Kahlo and Manuel Álvarez Bravo; and Georgia O’Keeffe and Ansel Adams. In other cases the photographer intentionally frames the photographic subject alongside the artist’s own work of art so that they become compelling participants in their own painted or sculptural compositions. This exhibition invites viewers to consider how the difficult task of representing another artist is productively accomplished through the collaborative aesthetic resonances discernable between model and photographer in these portraits.

18621,Exhibition: Changing Hands: Art Without Reservation 3 / Contemporary Native North American Art from the Northeast and Southeast,"Changing Hands: Art Without Reservation 3 explores the work of contemporary artists of Native North American origin working in both traditional and new media, acknowledging their long and diverse cultural legacies while overtly and simultaneously exploring, and often confronting, the many ongoing issues inherent to their cultural heritage. This exhibition is the culmination of a decade-long investigation and exploration into fine art created by Indigenous artists from North America, defined by their regional origins. This concluding exhibition of the three-part series presents new work by Native American, First Nations, Métis, and Inuit artists and designers from the Northeastern and Southeastern regions of the United States and Canada. Curated by Ellen Taubman, this Changing Hands presentation is the third in a series of exhibitions organized by the Museum of Arts and Design in New York. Changing Hands: Art Without Reservation 3 / Contemporary Native North American Art from the Northeast and Southeast was organized by the Museum of Arts and Design, New York, and made possible by the National Endowment for the Arts. The exhibition catalogue is made possible in part with the support of the Smithsonian Institution’s Indigenous Contemporary Arts Program.

18622,"Exhibition: Reductive Minimalism: Women Artists in Dialogue, 1960–2014","Nearly fifty years after its heyday, Minimalism is enjoying a resurgence of critical attention, though much of the focus continues to be on male artists or on a small number of women sculptors. Reductive Minimalism: Women Artists in Dialogue, 1960-2014 offers a fresh perspective on the movement and its evolution, bringing together formative works from two generations of women Minimalist painters to examine and celebrate the dialogue between them. Minimalism was born in the late 1950s as a reaction to the perceived hubris and theatricality of Abstract Expressionism. But though its most prominent, mostly male, practitioners favored an aesthetic of clean geometry and essential forms, the hubris remained—in oversized works with grandiose themes. Women Minimalist painters, however, took a more restrained or reductive approach, one more intimate in scale, more personal in narrative, and more open-ended in its experimentation with pure surface, color, and texture. Many of these women—Agnes Martin and Mary Corse among them—worked outside the New York art world and outside the critical discourse that would have offered them support and recognition. Gender politics, though not necessarily the impetus for their work, played a role in the circumstances of where and how they practiced. In spite of their relative isolation, their work had a profound influence on the current generation of women minimalist painters—including Tauba Auerbach and R.H. Quaytman—who have global exposure and who are celebrated in a varied and robust critical environment. In the gallery, Reductive Minimalism traces the conversation between these two generations in an installation of nine pairs of paintings, to reveal the call-and-response of their artistic symbiosis.

18643,Sally Fleming Master Class: Sr. Helen Prejean,"“Dead Man Walking, the Journey Continues” Sister Helen Prejean has been instrumental in sparking national dialogue on the death penalty and helping to shape the Catholic Church’s newly vigorous opposition to state executions. She travels around the world giving talks about her ministry. She considers herself a southern storyteller. Sister Helen is a member of the Congregation of St. Joseph. She spent her first years with the Sisters teaching religion to junior high school students. Realizing that being on the side of poor people is an essential part of the Gospel she moved into the St. Thomas Housing Project in New Orleans and began working at Hope House from 1981 – 1984. During this time, she was asked to correspond with a death row inmate Patrick Sonnier at Angola. She agreed and became his spiritual adviser. After witnessing his execution, she wrote a book about the experience. The result was Dead Man Walking: An Eyewitness Account of the Death Penalty in the United States. It became a movie, an opera and a play for high schools and colleges. Since 1984, Sister Helen has divided her time between educating citizens about the death penalty and counseling individual death row prisoners. She has accompanied six men to their deaths. In doing so, she began to suspect that some of those executed were not guilty. This realization inspired her second book, The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account of Wrongful Executions, which was released by Random House in December of 2004. Sr. Helen is presently at work on another book - RIVER OF FIRE: MY SPIRITUAL JOURNEY.",Map Rackham Graduate School (Horace H.) - Auditorium,['2014-11-13 15:00'],"['Free', 'Music']"
18651,Alice Walker Lecture,"The U-M Department of Afroamerican and African Studies (DAAS) and the Center for the Education of Women (CEW) will bring Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and activist, Alice Walker, to Hill Auditorium to deliver the 20th annual Zora Neale Hurston Lecture. As the 2014 guest lecturer, Ms. Walker will explore social justice issues from her unique womanist and black feminist perspective. Bringing scholarship and activism together, Ms. Walker will also reflect on the complimentary missions of DAAS and CEW. The Zora Neale Hurston Lecture at the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies honors Hurston, the most prolific African-American woman writer of her time, who brought to life the power, richness and complexity of black cultures for many readers. Alice Walker is a internationally celebrated ﻿award-winning ﻿author, poet and activist whose books include seven novels, four collections of short stories, four children’s books, and volumes of essays and poetry. Her work has been translated into more than two dozen languages, and her books have sold more than fifteen million copies. Walker is best known for The Color Purple, the 1983 novel for which she won the Pulitzer Prize—the first African American woman to win the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, though (in her opinion) not the first African American woman to deserve it. Along with the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, Walker’s awards and fellowships include a Guggenheim Fellowship and artist-in-residence at Yaddo and the McDowell Colony. In 2006, she was honored as one of the inaugural inductees into the California Hall of Fame. In 2007, her archives were opened to the public at Emory University. In 2010 she presented the keynote address at The 11th Annual Steve Biko Lecture at the University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa, and was awarded the Lennon/Ono Peace Grant in Reykjavik, Iceland.

Washington, Ann Arbor, MI. Increasing the economic security of women and their families is not only critical, but the subject of several bills in Congress and parallel efforts in state legislatures across the country. In an election year in which the women's vote may be an important determinant of the results, a women's economic agenda has particular saliency. Come learn about the importance of this agenda and its critical components, including: -The Paycheck Fairness Act to deter wage discrimination by closing loopholes in the Equal Pay Act and barring retaliation against workers who disclose their wages to coworkers. -The Strong Start for America's Children Act to fund high-quality early childhood education programs, which have been demonstrated to provide a huge return on investment. -The Fair Minimum Wage Act to help close the gender wage gap and increase pay for more than 15 million working women.

19345,Which is 'White' and Which 'Colored'?,"Some of the writings and interviews of Puerto Rican migrants settling in New York City during the interwar years of early twentieth century betray a sort of “cognitive dissonance”. This was particularly evident among those “white” migrants who struggled to explain their experiences with discrimination at the hands of other “white” New Yorkers. It seems they were registering a flux between the discourses of race and/or color circulating on the island-archipelago, and the ones they now encountered in the metropolis. There, the impulse against “racial amalgamation” had acquired some relatively fixed dimensions, with particular consequences for those whose Africanity was apparent or assumed. Growing out of the nexus between whiteness and politics, it matured into the “color-line”: a spatialization of race, labor, residence and crime which became synonymous with the very landscapes of cities like New York. For the waves of persons crowding its streets from the U.S. South and the Caribbean in the years after the First World War, this historical structure etched itself into their everyday lives. Among those Puerto Ricans residing in the area of Downtown Brooklyn at this time, it distributed them into clusters of relative color and occupational homogeneity, within and adjacent to those areas with the highest rates of arrest in the city. But the “dissonance” that this experience produced was not limited to a handful of the migrants. It is also apparent in those sources that contain narratives about or representations of race and/or color difference among those migrants. At first glance, these are often contradictory and incompatible, but a closer look suggests these discrepancies should be read as registers of the actual contingencies and the constants of that experience. Peter L. Carlo Becerra is an adjunct professor at the Sociology and Anthropology Department at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras. He is a graduate of the Doctoral Program in Sociology at SUNY-Binghamton, where he studied with Terence K. Hopkins, Kelvin Santiago-Valles, and Dale W. Tomich. He is a Bronx born and raised Nuyorican who has resided in the Puerto Rican archipelago for well over a decade, along with his two children. He is also a graduate of Lehman College-CUNY, and the public high schools of New York City. His ruminations on the entangled character of race and/or color, space, labor, crime, and politics in historic New York, are not just academic fare. They are constructs of the “conceptual evidence” of his experiences. He is also fond of designing and teaching courses in sociological method.

Professor in Social Work and Psychiatry, Faculty Associate, Research Center for Group Dynamics, Institute for Social Research Continuing Education credits for Social Workers are available; light refreshments will be provided. FREE! Abstract: College-aged black men experience higher levels of psychological distress due to their exposure to a greater frequency and severity of stress compared to other groups. For example, for more than a decade, mental health professionals have been concerned about the disproportionate increase in suicide among adolescent and young adult black males, because males account for 80% of the suicides among blacks. The frequency and severity of psychosocial stressors are exacerbated by other socio-demographic factors (i.e., age, household income, marital status, education level) that can influence the emotional and psychological health of black men. Likewise, studies have chronicled the psychological distress of young black men as a result of discrimination, negative attitudes toward the criminal justice system, racial and cultural identity, depression, violence, and issues involving their masculine gender norms. Research on black men in college is conflicting, as many studies underscore the benefits of educational achievement, while others focus on the challenges associated with gaining social capital and “upward mobility.” In this presentation, Professor Daphne C. Watkins (UM Social Work and Psychiatry) will discuss her research on young black men, masculinities, and how this influences their stress and ability to succeed. She will also discuss future directions in this area, such as her new Young black men, masculinities, and mental health (YBMen) project.",Map Michigan Union - Anderson Room of the Michigan Union,['2014-10-31 10:30'],"['African american', 'Alumni', 'Athletics', 'Detroit', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Food', 'Free', 'Greek life', 'Social justice']"

Roux, who was diagnosed at the age of 26, has been outspoken about his disease and has filmed newscasts about U-M’s research into the causes of type 1 diabetes. Chef Curtis Aikens (photo right), known for his work on The Food Network and other television shows, will host a Novo Nordisk Diabetes Academy Cooking Demo from 12:00 to 1:00 pm. The audience will be able to sample several dishes that he creates, and recipe cards will be given out for the dishes. A registered dietitian/certified diabetes educator will begin the presentation by speaking about healthy eating for people with diabetes. Aikens, who himself has type 2 diabetes, began his national TV career as a chef on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” where he was dubbed “the greengrocer who can cook.” He is one of the founding hosts of The Food Network, where he shared healthy recipes on shows such as “Food in a Flash,” and demonstrated how to use fresh produce on “Pick of the Day” and “Meals Without Meat.” Curtis lives by the motto “practice makes permanent,” and encourages others to make a lifestyle choice of eating healthy without sacrificing flavor. The purpose of the diabetes health fair is to inform the public about managing all forms of diabetes: type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes, and diabetes in pregnancy (gestational diabetes), as well as about handling diabetes complications — and, ideally, how to avoid complications and prevent type 2 diabetes. Medical professionals from the U-M Comprehensive Diabetes Center and the U-M Health System will provide the latest information on diabetes prevention and treatment, based on their ground-breaking research at U-M. The free presentations (first-come, first-served seating) are: 9:30 am: ""Diabetes Updates from the Pediatric Clinic and Research Lab"" by Brigid Gregg, MD, Physician and Clinical Lecturer, Pediatric Endocrinology Division, U-M Mott Children's Hospital 10:30 am: “Popular Diets: Finding the Right Balance for Diabetes and Heart Health” - Joyce Patterson, MPH, RD, Clinical Dietitian, U-M Health System, Cardiovascular Medicine 12:00 pm: ""Cooking Demo with Food Network Chef Curtis Aikens” - sponsored by the Novo Nordisk Diabetes Academy Free screenings will be given (as time and supplies permit) for: •blood sugar and A1c •blood pressure •cholesterol (HDL, triglycerides, and total, non-fasting) Additional screenings only for people with diabetes: •foot screenings •eye exams For relatives of people with type 1 diabetes: •Blood tests to check for antibodies will be available, offered by the TrialNet Study. Free body-mass calculations and waist-to-hip ratios also will be offered, to assess obesity and determine the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. A medication review by the College of Pharmacy will check for potential complications and drug interactions. Diabetes medical supply and pharmaceutical companies will be on hand to display their latest products and to answer questions. There will also be a doctor consultation table where patrons can review their screening results with an endocrinologist. The platinum sponsor is MedEquip, the public’s U-M source for diabetes supplies. Premium sponsors that also have helped to make this event possible are: Eli Lilly & Co., Novo Nordisk, Dexcom, and Tandem Diabetes Care.

20123,Flip Your Field: Objects from the Collection,"For the third installation of the Flip Your Field series, UMMA invites Georgios Skiniotis, Professor of Biological Chemistry at U-M’s Life Sciences Institute and Medical School, to curate an exhibition from the Museum’s collection of three-dimensional objects. As a scientist, Skiniotis creates three-dimensional models of cellular components by combining their magnified shadows or projections viewed from different perspectives. This type of study inevitably raises questions regarding the cognition of the objects around us—how, in the absence of perspective, are we to read elements like color, contrast variation, and depth of field in the dark outlines of objects? How do we make the cognitive connection between a two-dimensional shadow and the three-dimensional object that casts it? How many two-dimensional projections are needed for us to understand what we are looking at, and at what level of detail? This exhibition poses such questions by juxtaposing three-dimensional objects from the Museum’s collection with two-dimensional projections created by Skiniotis using a similar process with which he creates models of cellular components. The presentation aims to provide a glimpse of the impressions of the selected works from varied directions through interplay with their own projections and our minds. The UMMA Flip Your Field series asks noted University of Michigan faculty members to consider artwork outside their field of specialization in order to guest curate an exhibition using works from UMMA's renowned collection.

As opposed to male practitioners who favored oversized works with grandiose themes, women Minimalists took a more restrained or reductive approach, one more intimate in scale, more personal in narrative.

Forger argues that organ music has been subject to ""Big Data"" for at least 100 years, as modern keyboard action transforms each note played into a simple on and off command to a pipe. He will also argue that the Bach Trio Sonatas are ideal candidates for ""Big Data"" analysis since Bach is the natural starting point for musical analysis, the trio sonatas were important to Bach, and the trio sonatas have a very uniform structure. Forger has captured this code generated by my performance of the Trio Sonatas, by hacking into the modern organ in his home, and analyzed it, using some preliminary mathematical techniques. As he performs the Trio Sonatas, graphs showing preliminary analysis will be presented.

20407,Re-Imaging Gender - A Juried Art Exhibition,"Our understandings of gender have shifted dramatically in recent decades. No longer is gender a matter of an immutable binary, or a set of predetermined preferences and predilections. This exhibition--the first of its kind--both celebrates and interrogates the visual aspects of the re- imaging of gender. Re-imaging Gender features the work of 15 promising artists who take on one of the most important challenges facing contemporary art: how to render the modern spectrum of gender, going beyond the simple male/female binary to include a wide variety of identities and sexualities. The Re-imaging artists, MFA students enrolled at Michigan and CIC universities (Big 10, plus Chicago), responded to an IRWG-issued Call for Art. The result is an exhibition of 17 works in a variety of media, including photography, paint, lithograph, mixed media, and video, which reflect new understandings of gender. The exhibit will be displayed at the Lane Hall Gallery, a space shared by IRWG and the U-M Department of Women’s Studies, from January 15 - June 26, 2015.",Map Lane Hall - Gallery space on first floor,"['2015-01-16 8:00', '2015-01-19 8:00', '2015-01-20 8:00', '2015-01-21 8:00', '2015-01-22 8:00', '2015-01-23 8:00', '2015-01-26 8:00', '2015-01-27 8:00', '2015-01-28 8:00', '2015-01-29 8:00', '2015-01-30 8:00', '2015-02-02 8:00', '2015-02-03 8:00', '2015-02-04 8:00', '2015-02-05 8:00', '2015-02-06 8:00', '2015-02-09 8:00', '2015-02-10 8:00', '2015-02-11 8:00', '2015-02-12 8:00', '2015-02-13 8:00', '2015-02-16 8:00', '2015-02-17 8:00', '2015-02-18 8:00', '2015-02-19 8:00', '2015-02-20 8:00', '2015-02-23 8:00', '2015-02-24 8:00', '2015-02-25 8:00', '2015-02-26 8:00', '2015-02-27 8:00', '2015-03-02 8:00', '2015-03-03 8:00', '2015-03-04 8:00', '2015-03-05 8:00', '2015-03-06 8:00', '2015-03-09 8:00', '2015-03-10 8:00', '2015-03-11 8:00', '2015-03-12 8:00', '2015-03-13 8:00', '2015-03-16 8:00', '2015-03-17 8:00', '2015-03-18 8:00', '2015-03-19 8:00', '2015-03-20 8:00', '2015-03-23 8:00', '2015-03-24 8:00', '2015-03-25 8:00', '2015-03-26 8:00', '2015-03-27 8:00', '2015-03-30 8:00', '2015-03-31 8:00', '2015-04-01 8:00', '2015-04-02 8:00', '2015-04-03 8:00', '2015-04-06 8:00', '2015-04-07 8:00', '2015-04-08 8:00', '2015-04-09 8:00', '2015-04-10 8:00', '2015-04-13 8:00', '2015-04-14 8:00', '2015-04-15 8:00', '2015-04-16 8:00', '2015-04-17 8:00', '2015-04-20 8:00', '2015-04-21 8:00', '2015-04-22 8:00', '2015-04-23 8:00', '2015-04-24 8:00', '2015-04-27 8:00', '2015-04-28 8:00', '2015-04-29 8:00', '2015-04-30 8:00', '2015-05-01 8:00', '2015-05-04 8:00', '2015-05-05 8:00', '2015-05-06 8:00', '2015-05-07 8:00', '2015-05-08 8:00', '2015-05-11 8:00', '2015-05-12 8:00', '2015-05-13 8:00', '2015-05-14 8:00', '2015-05-15 8:00', '2015-05-18 8:00', '2015-05-19 8:00', '2015-05-20 8:00', '2015-05-21 8:00', '2015-05-22 8:00', '2015-05-26 8:00', '2015-05-27 8:00', '2015-05-28 8:00', '2015-05-29 8:00', '2015-06-01 8:00', '2015-06-02 8:00', '2015-06-03 8:00', '2015-06-04 8:00', '2015-06-05 8:00', '2015-06-08 8:00', '2015-06-09 8:00', '2015-06-10 8:00', '2015-06-11 8:00', '2015-06-12 8:00', '2015-06-15 8:00', '2015-06-16 8:00', '2015-06-17 8:00', '2015-06-18 8:00', '2015-06-19 8:00', '2015-06-22 8:00', '2015-06-23 8:00', '2015-06-24 8:00', '2015-06-25 8:00', '2015-06-26 8:00']","['Exhibition', 'Free', 'Lgbt', 'Literary arts', 'Visual arts', ""Women's studies""]"

20670,Uncanny Valley,"Guy Michael Davis and Katie Parker (collaboratively working under the name Future Retrieval) The objects presented merge the strengths of our studio practice – a dark vein backed by a historical current. Ornament and detail collide with a fascination of taxidermy and natural order. Each object contains a history, reaching back and highlighting ideals of time and labor. Three-dimensional scans and photographs have been rapid prototyped, processed in the studio, and molded into porcelain mimicking the world of European decorative arts. Inspired also by German animal sculptures and cut silhouettes, we are using digital translation to both highlight and transform these details that fascinate us. The interest in new technologies and industrial methods is that each piece is handmade, but maintains the record of a computer driven interpretation. Our intention is to make art objects that reference design and are held together by craft. Bio Future Retrieval Guy Michael Davis was born in 1978 and raised in Bartlesville, OK. Katie Parker was born in 1980 in Jonesboro Arkansas, and grew up in Plano, Texas. They both attended the Kansas City Art Institute from 1999-2003 and received BFA degrees in ceramics. Katie went straight to graduate school at The Ohio State University from 2003-2005, Guy followed suit three years later from 2006-2008. Both Katie and Guy received MFA degrees in ceramics. Currently, Katie is an Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati, running the ceramics department. Guy works for multiple designers across the country, and is an adjunct Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati. For several years, they have also been collaborating together, making objects that combine new technology, porcelain, and good craft.

20671,Uncanny Valley,"Gallery Opening Reception Guy Michael Davis and Katie Parker (collaboratively working under the name Future Retrieval) The objects presented merge the strengths of our studio practice – a dark vein backed by a historical current. Ornament and detail collide with a fascination of taxidermy and natural order. Each object contains a history, reaching back and highlighting ideals of time and labor. Three-dimensional scans and photographs have been rapid prototyped, processed in the studio, and molded into porcelain mimicking the world of European decorative arts. Inspired also by German animal sculptures and cut silhouettes, we are using digital translation to both highlight and transform these details that fascinate us. The interest in new technologies and industrial methods is that each piece is handmade, but maintains the record of a computer driven interpretation. Our intention is to make art objects that reference design and are held together by craft. Bio Future Retrieval Guy Michael Davis was born in 1978 and raised in Bartlesville, OK. Katie Parker was born in 1980 in Jonesboro Arkansas, and grew up in Plano, Texas. They both attended the Kansas City Art Institute from 1999-2003 and received BFA degrees in ceramics. Katie went straight to graduate school at The Ohio State University from 2003-2005, Guy followed suit three years later from 2006-2008. Both Katie and Guy received MFA degrees in ceramics. Currently, Katie is an Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati, running the ceramics department. Guy works for multiple designers across the country, and is an adjunct Assistant Professor at the University of Cincinnati. For several years, they have also been collaborating together, making objects that combine new technology, porcelain, and good craft.

Focusing on the Balkans as an exemplary territory plagued by violence, this lecture traces the parallel rise of the nation and the vampire. The figure of the legendary bloodsucker is permeated with a negative cultural coding of excessive violence and sexuality. Yet, this figure thrives in the European cultural subcontinent of the Balkans, where nationalism is perceived by the centers of power, knowledge and meaning as a particularly fierce one. The connection between violent national imaginary and the post-Oriental condition the Balkan Slavs find themselves in after the Ottoman rule is analyzed by tracing the invention of “the serbs” as a prototypical example of the discursively engendered vampire nation. The European center refuses to see its own distorted mirror image in the abhorrent parasite requiring blood for its food.",Map Angell Hall - G127,['2015-02-24 11:30'],"['European', 'Film', 'Free', 'International', 'Literature', 'Music', 'Politics']"

20871,Penny Stamps Speaker Series: Tacita Dean,"Tacita Dean’s film portraits express something that neither painting nor photography can capture. They are purely film. Dean‘s art is carried by a sense of history, time and place, light quality and the essence of film itself. The focus of her subtle but ambitious work is the truth of the moment, the film as a medium and the sensibilities of the individual. Dean’s solo exhibitions include Tate Britain, London; Schaulager, Basel; the Guggenheim Museum, New York; Nicola Trussardi Foundation, Milan; and MUMOK, Vienna. She was awarded the Hugo Boss Prize in 2006 and the Kurt Schwitters Prize in 2009. In 2011, she made FILM as part of the Unilever series of commissions in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, which marked the beginning of her campaign to protect the medium of photochemical film (savefilm.org).

The monstrous transformations of ""The Fantastic Four"" placed its heroes outside the bounds of Cold War gender and sexual norms: their bodies had mutated in ways that destabilized their assumed gender and sexual identities. In this talk, Ramzi Fawaz explores the surprisingly queer evolution of the series, which used the mutated bodies of its heroes to depict the transformation of the bread-winning father, doting wife, and bickering male siblings of the 1950s nuclear family into icons of 1960s radicalism: the left-wing intellectual, the liberal feminist, the political activist, and the potential queer.",Map Lane Hall - 2239,['2015-02-26 16:00'],"['Books', 'Culture', 'Film', 'Free', 'History', 'Lgbt', 'Social']"

21356,"Guido van der Werve: Nummer veertien, home","Nummer veertien, home, Dutch artist Guido van der Werve’s 54-minute film, weaves together three stories of journeys away from home: the death of Frédéric Chopin in Paris and his sister’s quest to bring the composer’s heart back to his native Poland for burial; Van der Werve’s own quest to retrace, in reverse, the route of Chopin’s heart in a three-week, thousand-mile trek of biking, running, and swimming; and the story of Alexander the Great, a traveling warrior who is one of Van der Werve’s personal heroes. The film explores themes that are common in Van der Werve’s work: extreme physical and mental endurance, man’s struggle with the intensity of nature, the interplay of history and geography, the power of melancholy, and the solitary traveler. The artist’s signature sensibility—simultaneously surreal and deadpan—is accentuated in the film by the full orchestra that accompanies him on every stage of his journey. Van der Werve spent a year composing the film’s score, a classical requiem for forty voices and twenty strings, and the film’s structure mirrors that of the requiem: three movements of four acts apiece, with each act introduced by title shots to reinforce this organizational system. The tripartite framework underscores the three legs of Van der Werve’s personal triathlon and the three odysseys that intersect and inform one another throughout the film.

21357,HE: The Hergott Shepard Photography Collection,"For more than 25 years, Los Angeles-based collectors Alan Hergott and Curt Shepard have built a world-class collection of contemporary art that is focused on men and male identity as its subject matter. This exhibition features works from their vast holdings in photography. Guest curator Mario Codognato examines the lives of men in contemporary Western societies—with all their contradictions—through themes of competition and solidarity, confrontation with identity, and diverse explorations of the body and sexuality (as both sign and experience). Together, these thematic groups form a fictional, somewhat idealized, tale in 13 chapters, inviting viewers to reflect upon their own stories as well. Drawing upon the Hergott Shepard collection as well as select works gifted by the collectors to the Hammer Museum at UCLA, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), the exhibition will include more than 60 works by some of the most important names in late 20th and early 21st century art, including Doug Aitken, John Baldessari, Matthew Barney, Rineke Dijkstra, Gilbert and George, Nan Goldin, Robert Mapplethorpe, Catherine Opie, Herb Ritts, Thomas Ruff, Andres Serrano, and Wolfgang Tillmans.

21399,U-M Museum Studies Program presents: Inextinguishable—A Conversation with Detroit Artist Tyree Guyton,"Rackham Graduate School 4th Floor East Conference Room For almost 30 years, the abandoned houses that dot Detroit’s Heidelberg Street have provided the backdrop to a kaleidoscopic display of outdoor art installations that aim to inspire and provide healing to the local community. In 2013 and 2014, a series of 12 arson fires gutted six installations on the Street, the most devastating assault on the Heidelberg Project in over 20 years. Renowned artist Tyree Guyton has used this opportunity to re-double his efforts on the Heidelberg Project. Debris and ash have been cleared away and new art emerges from the foundations of the burned out structures, working through the walls of charred basements, surfacing with creative new visions and voice. In his first major public appearance since the fires, Tyree Guyton discusses new construction on Heidelberg Street, a forthcoming history of the site, a new museum, more work with the local community, and exciting ideas for new art resulting from the fires. The community grounded model provided by the Heidelberg Project continues to fascinate museum professionals, providing a connection from the non-collecting museums first proposed by John Cotton Dana in the early 20th century to the socially relevant museums advocated in our own time by Stephen Weil and Elaine Heumann Gurian. Join us for a conversation on perseverance and the creative spirit with Tyree Guyton—an icon whose flame exceeds the 12 collective arsons that were visited upon his site. A reception will follow along with opportunities for the audience to meet and ask questions of the artist.

The film explores the creation, creators and lasting impact of one of the most universally beloved children’s books of our time. Mr. Juster will shed further light on the creative process and themes in the novel. Reviews of The Phantom Tollbooth have appeared in many national publications including The New Yorker, which hailed the book as “a classic,” and The New York Times, which said “Norton Juster’s amazing fantasy has something wonderful for anybody old enough to relish the allegorical wisdom of Alice in Wonderland and the pointed whimsy of The Wizard of Oz.” The Phantom Tollbooth has currently sold close to four million copies since its publication almost 50 years ago. Born in June of 1929 in Brooklyn, New York, Norton Juster was an architect and planner, and is professor emeritus of design at Hampshire College. In addition to The Phantom Tollbooth, he has also penned a number of other highly acclaimed children’s books including The Dot and the Line, which was made into an Academy Award-winning animated film, and the recent The Hello, Goodbye Window, illustrated by Chris Raschka, which was awarded a Caldecott Medal. The musical adaptation of The Phantom Tollbooth, which was first introduced 15 years ago, continues to be performed in schools and theaters nationwide, and was recently produced at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, touring the country for eight months.

21577,The 8th Annual Faeth Memorial Lecture,"Abstract: This talk will explore short pulsed microwave and laser based methods that provide new opportunities for control and analysis of complex flow fields. Micro: The natural ionization that is produced in flames provides a mechanism for high efficiency, localized energy deposition using KHz rate, microsecond long pulses of microwave radiation. Deposition of only ~3% of the power associated with a laminar methane-air flame leads to a 20% increase in the flame speed and a factor of two reduction of the lean combustion limit. Nano: The dynamic change in temperature in the flame zone is monitored with nanosecond pulsed filtered Rayleigh scattering, which provides a time frozen image of the temperature field. Pico: Nitric oxide production is monitored with picosecond Radar REMPI, which can also provide a localized measure of atomic species in the flame. Femto: Microwave coupling to femtosecond laser generated ionization provides a method for simultaneous ignition along a line. Microwave coupling to femtosecond laser ionization patterns also provides a method for localized energy addition for drag reduction and steering of supersonic objects and vehicles. The motion of high speed air can be monitored with Femtosecond Laser Electronic Excitation Tagging (FLEET). The figure below shows FLEET lines written across a vertical underexpanded supersonic air jet, providing instantaneous images of the velocity profile and a measure of the centerline velocity.

22050,"""Expanding the Diversity Conversation:","Presentations followed by Q&A Presentors: KYRA GAUNT, Ph.D., Digital Ethnomusicologist, Adjunct Associate Lecturer— Baruch College- The City University of New York (CUNY); (Ph.D. 1997, University of Michigan) and PCCS Director ED SARATH, Professor of Music, Department of Jazz & Contemporary Improvisation- SMTD In this shared presentation, Kyra Gaunt, Ph.D., Baruch College-CUNY, and Ed Sarath, U-M Program in Creativity & Consciousness Studies (PCCS), will extend the boundaries of typical conversations concerning diversity by exploring the areas of art and consciousness and the profound ramifications that they have for diversity. Art and consciousness have not been part of diversity discourse near to the extent that is possible, and that is arguably needed, if genuine progress is to be made. The limited connection between art and diversity is particularly evident in music studies, with its strong monocultural center. Furthermore, consciousness—defined in our presentation as a core facet of human experience that includes the innermost, transcendent dimensions of subjective awareness—is even more distant in academic diversity discourse. PCCS' special guest, Dr. Gaunt, is the author of *The Games Black Girls Play: Learning the Ropes from Double-Dutch to Hip-Hop*. In her wide-ranging approach to her work and teaching, Gaunt epitomizes the ideas of creativity, diversity, transcendence, and passionate activism. This event is open to all U-M affiliates, community scholars, and the general public. Light refreshments will be served.

The script, written by local playwright Mary Butler, is largely based on professor Caryl Flinn's book Brass Diva: The Life and Legends of Ethel Merman. Butler’s work is a philosophical exploration of mental illness that manages to find moments of humor as it highlights the short life of Merman's daughter ""Little Bit"" who suffered from depression and anxiety disorders. Lindsay will direct the reading which will include area professional actors, student actors, and the talents of two visiting actresses, Rita McKenzie, longtime Ethel Merman tribute artist, and Barbara Geary, Ethel Merman's granddaughter and accomplished actress, director, playwright, and artist.",Map Walgreen Drama Center - Studio One,['2015-03-20 19:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'North campus', 'Storytelling', 'Theater']"

22265,Sophie Calle: North Pole,"Following her mother's death, French conceptual artist Sophie Calle wanted to bury her portrait and jewels on a glacier in the North Pole, a place her mother had always dreamed of seeing. This multifaceted installation, consisting of video, photographs, and a light box, documents moments of Calle's journey to fulfill her mother's unrealized dream. North Pole / Pôle nord also includes three porcelain plaques on which Calle has inscribed a story about her voyage. The following text is an excerpt: ""I waited to reach the northernmost point on the trip in order to go ashore and bury my mother's jewels. L., my cabin-mate on the boat, suggested that if the weather was not permitting, I could still flush the ring down the toilet. The prospect would have made my mother laugh. But on Thursday October 2, 2008, the weather was fine. I ventured onto the glacier, chose a beautiful stone and buried the portrait, the necklace and the diamond. Now my mother has gone to the Arctic North. Will climate change carry her out to sea as far as the Pole? Will she be dragged down the valley towards the ice cap? Will she stay on that shore, a marker of the Northern Glacier’s existence in the Holocene period?"" The creative process that drives North Pole is characteristic of Calle's practice: she not only shares a story drawn from her own life, but uses that moment to inspire further artistic exploration. Following a set of self-established behavioral instructions, she transforms her daily life with a series of performative actions, usually executed as a combination of texts and photographs. The result is a poignant reconsideration of the parameters of public versus private life, through a body of work grounded in compelling, and often very intimate, personal investigation. This exhibition is made possible in part by the Robert and Janet Miller Fund.",Map Museum of Art,"['2015-05-02 11:00', '2015-05-03 12:00', '2015-05-05 11:00', '2015-05-06 11:00', '2015-05-07 11:00', '2015-05-08 11:00', '2015-05-09 11:00', '2015-05-10 12:00', '2015-05-12 11:00', '2015-05-13 11:00', '2015-05-14 11:00', '2015-05-15 11:00', '2015-05-16 11:00', '2015-05-17 12:00', '2015-05-19 11:00', '2015-05-20 11:00', '2015-05-21 11:00', '2015-05-22 11:00', '2015-05-23 11:00', '2015-05-24 12:00', '2015-05-26 11:00', '2015-05-27 11:00', '2015-05-28 11:00', '2015-05-29 11:00', '2015-05-30 11:00', '2015-05-31 12:00', '2015-06-02 11:00', '2015-06-03 11:00', '2015-06-04 11:00', '2015-06-05 11:00', '2015-06-06 11:00', '2015-06-07 12:00', '2015-06-09 11:00', '2015-06-10 11:00', '2015-06-11 11:00', '2015-06-12 11:00', '2015-06-13 11:00', '2015-06-14 12:00', '2015-06-16 11:00', '2015-06-17 11:00', '2015-06-18 11:00', '2015-06-19 11:00', '2015-06-20 11:00', '2015-06-21 12:00', '2015-06-23 11:00', '2015-06-24 11:00', '2015-06-25 11:00', '2015-06-26 11:00', '2015-06-27 11:00', '2015-06-28 12:00', '2015-06-30 11:00', '2015-07-01 11:00', '2015-07-02 11:00', '2015-07-03 11:00', '2015-07-04 11:00', '2015-07-05 12:00', '2015-07-07 11:00', '2015-07-08 11:00', '2015-07-09 11:00', '2015-07-10 11:00', '2015-07-11 11:00', '2015-07-12 12:00', '2015-07-14 11:00', '2015-07-15 11:00', '2015-07-16 11:00', '2015-07-17 11:00', '2015-07-18 11:00', '2015-07-19 12:00', '2015-07-21 11:00', '2015-07-22 11:00', '2015-07-23 11:00', '2015-07-24 11:00', '2015-07-25 11:00', '2015-07-26 12:00', '2015-07-28 11:00', '2015-07-29 11:00', '2015-07-30 11:00', '2015-07-31 11:00', '2015-08-01 11:00', '2015-08-02 12:00', '2015-08-04 11:00', '2015-08-05 11:00', '2015-08-06 11:00', '2015-08-07 11:00', '2015-08-08 11:00', '2015-08-09 12:00']","['Art', 'Culture', 'Discussion', 'Exhibition', 'Family', 'Free', 'Language', 'Lifelong learning', 'Museum', 'Storytelling', 'Umma', 'Visual arts']"
22267,Mine More Coal: War Effort and Americanism in World War I Posters,"During World War I, the American Government used a powerful poster campaign to rally all troops and farmers, housewives and shipbuilders, “old-stock Americans” and immigrants to the cause. Propaganda, commodity, and art came together in WWI posters. This exhibition presents rarely displayed WWI posters from UMMA’s collection. The focus of the exhibition is posters directed at coal miners. These works explore the larger themes of supporting the war effort and Americanism. Coal mining communities were microcosms for the social and economic pressures when the United States entered the Great War in 1917. Coal was a central resource for the war, yet the immigrant workforce was considered unreliable because of increasingly frequent workers’ strikes. Posters also addressed anxieties about the definition of American culture and its readiness for war. Marking the centennial of the Great War (1914-1919), the presentation of WWI posters of the UMMA collection includes some of the lesser-known works by America’s most famous poster artists. From iconic Gibson-girl type illustrations to multilingual posters in Polish, Italian, and German, these posters present war-time American ideals. Works by famed designers James Montgomery Flagg, the designer of the Uncle Sam “I Want You” poster, and Howard Christy are featured alongside works by illustrators like J.C.

This program is designed for people who live at home and their companions. If you or someone you care about is experiencing mild memory loss, research has shown that the visual and expressive arts can be good for your mind. In addition, great enjoyment is to be found in seeking out the sights, sounds, textures, and good feelings that come with looking at, learning, and sharing feelings about paintings, music, and other creative arts. UMMA's trained docents will accompany small groups for a guided tour and provide the opportunity for everyone to experience different kinds of art and share their responses. Save the date for future Meet Me at UMMA tours: Sundays at 1pm, July 12 and October 4.

22456,FOKUS presents VANGUARDS 2015: VOICE,"Free food, art, music, games - everything you need to end a great semester and kick off a much needed summer! Featuring ROCNATION Recording Artist & Detroit's very own Mayaeni, Citywide Poets (Detroit, MI), AnnaMalistiik, Yada Yada, and more! We will also have a sexual assault awareness installation by I Will, a journal group led by a NELP alum, a photo booth, and more! VANGUARDS 2015: Voice The University of Michigan has historically been a haven for activism and social change, offering the perfect environment to stand up and make your voice heard. In the past, these movements have created community and brought people together. This year there has been a resurgence of activism, but instead of bringing people together, this movement has focused on our differences instead of focusing on what we have in common. Within each of our distinct races and social identities, we are all students, and more importantly, we are all artists. VANGUARDS: VOICE seeks to bring people from every part of campus together, with art as the common medium, to remind us that we share this common thread. | ABOUT FOKUS | FOKUS nurtures success in communities by exposing community members to unexpected art experiences. This exposure helps them discover their own creativity and use it to better their communities. One driving force of the organization is to highlight the fact that art plays a role in everything from education to entertainment to activism to health to community building and much more. We believe that the arts enable people to rise above barriers in society by creating new ways of thinking, communicating and interacting. FOKUS’s mission is to educate, empower and unite communities through the arts. | WHAT IS VANGUARDS? | VANGUARDS is an annual event that started in April of 2005 that is produced by FIGHTING OBSTACLES KNOWING ULTIMATE SUCCESS (FOKUS). Modeled with respect to a classic block party, Vanguards is FOKUS’s flagship event, showcasing and introducing the FOKUS vision of inclusivity, fun, creativity, and collaborative learning to a wide array of students, professors, staff, and Ann Arbor community. | ENTERTAINMENT | This year we are bringing out several performers. Headlining the event will be Detroit-based singer and guitarist Mayaeni, who is signed to RocNation Records and is the Midwest’s most up-and-coming artist. CityWide Poets, a Detroit-based poetry troupe composed of high school students, will accentuate Vanguards with a main stage performance. Drop-in workshops, student performances, and collaborative activities with other student led organizations will round out the event. After the event, we will create a portfolio of visual, spoken, and written expressions of voice shared at VANGUARDS 2015.",Map Diag - Central Campus,['2015-04-11 13:00'],"['Art', 'Concert', 'Culture', 'Dance', 'Detroit', 'Festival', 'Food', 'Free', 'Games', 'Multicultural', 'Music', 'Networking', 'Outdoors', 'Poetry', 'Social justice', 'Storytelling', 'Visual arts', 'Writing']"

22644,Opera Workshop: The Three Sopranos,"Kay Castaldo, director James Schmid, Impresario director Steven McGhee, musical director The Three Sopranos, an adaption of Mozart’s The Impresario, and Offenbach’s Le Mariage aux Lanternes, showcases a group of eccentric performers trying to create an extravagant opera production to finish out a shaky theatrical season. With their director, Max’s, health collapsing, Barney, his assistant, and Angel, a wealthy friend and physician who is backing the show, struggle to take the reigns of the company, now an opera company to top off the problems. The group makes a fatal “first timers” error by only considering three sopranos for casting. Now, the battling divas’ tantrums leave the production in a state of hysterical tension. Their passion as artists and performers clashes with the reality of producing a fully staged show.","The Carr Center, 311 E. Grand River, Detroit, MI",['2015-04-19 16:30'],"['Free', 'Music']"

Despite the objections and concerns of her family, Juana decides to pursue her dream of becoming an expert sushi chef, to go where her heart tells her, not where she is expected to be. Faced with the obstacles of being the wrong gender and race for her chosen profession, Juana must overcome the doubters to succeed where no one like her ever has.

And yet the vast majority of Americans seem either unaware of or unconcerned about the catastrophe we are careening toward. The Climate Mobilization Pledge is a social movement strategy, designed to fight denial and build political power. When someone signs the Pledge to Mobilize, they agree to vote for candidates on the local, state, and national level who understand that climate change is an acute global crisis and to call for a whole society, all-out climate mobilization. Join us on Sunday afternoon at Liberty Plaza. Take the Climate Mobilization Pledge and join Buzz Alexander and others in an open mic session to read your favorite poems celebrating the beauty of the planet or the issues of climate change.","Liberty Plaza, 255 E.

23179,Jem Cohen,"The title of this multi-format photography and video installation by New York filmmaker Jem Cohen comes from the artist’s own characterization of his practice. As he explains, “The unifying core of my work stems from encountering the world as it unfolds. Whether the project is long- or short-term, moving image or still photography, single pictures, multiple projections, or an installation, it is through close observation, careful listening, and an embrace of chance that I establish the bedrock. . . . Regardless of the tools and the form, the project is . . . life drawing.” The dual-gallery presentation of Life Drawing at UMMA underscores Cohen’s use of disparate media that, rooted in a shared set of concerns and working methods, organically coalesce into a broader body of work. We Have an Anchor, on view in the Media Gallery, is a single-channel video projection that incorporates composited 16mm, Super 8, and HD imagery. An environmental portrait of Nova Scotia, it takes its departure point from a live performance with multiple projections where Cohen collaborated with an ensemble of musicians to make what has been described as a cinematic love letter to Nova Scotia's Cape Breton. Footage of the island, gathered over 10 years, is interspersed with texts ranging from poems to local folklore, buoyed by both environmental sounds and an original score written and performed by members from a diverse group of bands, including Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Dirty Three, Fugazi, White Magic, Silver Mt. Zion, and The Quavers. In the Photography Gallery, more than 25 still photographs, again gathered over a long period in a disappearing analog format (in this case, Polaroid film), are subtly married to digital technology. The images, some urban and some domestic, are from a variety of locations ranging from New York to Tangier. With both the video and the photographs Cohen uses a strategy of free wandering conjoined with careful documentation in order to unearth and celebrate hidden, seemingly haunted geographies and their human (and animal) inhabitants.",Map Museum of Art,"['2015-08-08 11:00', '2015-08-09 12:00', '2015-08-11 11:00', '2015-08-12 11:00', '2015-08-13 11:00', '2015-08-14 11:00', '2015-08-15 11:00', '2015-08-16 12:00', '2015-08-18 11:00', '2015-08-19 11:00', '2015-08-20 11:00', '2015-08-21 11:00', '2015-08-22 11:00', '2015-08-23 12:00', '2015-08-25 11:00', '2015-08-26 11:00', '2015-08-27 11:00', '2015-08-28 11:00', '2015-08-29 11:00', '2015-08-30 12:00', '2015-09-01 11:00', '2015-09-02 11:00', '2015-09-03 11:00', '2015-09-04 11:00', '2015-09-05 11:00', '2015-09-06 12:00', '2015-09-08 11:00', '2015-09-09 11:00', '2015-09-10 11:00', '2015-09-11 11:00', '2015-09-12 11:00', '2015-09-13 12:00', '2015-09-15 11:00', '2015-09-16 11:00', '2015-09-17 11:00', '2015-09-18 11:00', '2015-09-19 11:00', '2015-09-20 12:00', '2015-09-22 11:00', '2015-09-23 11:00', '2015-09-24 11:00', '2015-09-25 11:00', '2015-09-26 11:00', '2015-09-27 12:00', '2015-09-29 11:00', '2015-09-30 11:00', '2015-10-01 11:00', '2015-10-02 11:00', '2015-10-03 11:00', '2015-10-04 12:00', '2015-10-06 11:00', '2015-10-07 11:00', '2015-10-08 11:00', '2015-10-09 11:00', '2015-10-10 11:00', '2015-10-11 12:00', '2015-10-13 11:00', '2015-10-14 11:00', '2015-10-15 11:00', '2015-10-16 11:00', '2015-10-17 11:00', '2015-10-18 12:00', '2015-10-20 11:00', '2015-10-21 11:00', '2015-10-22 11:00', '2015-10-23 11:00', '2015-10-24 11:00', '2015-10-25 12:00', '2015-10-27 11:00', '2015-10-28 11:00', '2015-10-29 11:00', '2015-10-30 11:00', '2015-10-31 11:00', '2015-11-01 12:00', '2015-11-03 11:00', '2015-11-04 11:00', '2015-11-05 11:00', '2015-11-06 11:00', '2015-11-07 11:00', '2015-11-08 12:00', '2015-11-10 11:00', '2015-11-11 11:00', '2015-11-12 11:00', '2015-11-13 11:00', '2015-11-15 12:00', '2015-11-17 11:00', '2015-11-18 11:00', '2015-11-19 11:00', '2015-11-20 11:00', '2015-11-22 12:00', '2015-11-24 11:00', '2015-11-25 11:00', '2015-11-26 11:00', '2015-11-27 11:00', '2015-11-29 12:00']","['Art', 'Culture', 'Education', 'Exhibition', 'Free', 'Umma', 'Visual arts']"

23586,Soviet Constructivist Posters,"During the 1920s the Soviet Union emerged on the world stage. The first decade was full of hope for a new social order that would reject the values and traditions of Tsarist rule. Centered in Moscow, a group of young artists, spearheaded in part by Vladimir (1899-1982) and Georgy Stenberg (1900-1933), championed an art that promoted the egalitarian ideals of the New Order and contributed to the growth of the Soviet Union. Known as the Constructivists, they advocated for utilitarian art that was easily accessible and spoke to the masses. Among their most provocative and visionary works were posters advertising Soviet films. UMMA’s exhibition, Soviet Constructivist Posters: Branding the New Order features a selection of posters by the Stenbergs and other Constructivists for some of early cinema’s most inventive films including, Sergei Eisenstein’sOctober and Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera. Using dynamic compositions, bold colors, and emblematic images, these posters announced that the Soviet Union was a progressive nation that could propel society into a utopian future. Their revolutionary aesthetic became associated with the workers’ movement and helped to shape how it was understood both at home and abroad. Though Constructivism went out of favor in the 1930s with the rise of Joseph Stalin (1878–1953), Constructivist designs continued to have an influence abroad. Today, their legacy can be seen in advertisements and other promotional materials made for the public eye.

23595,Julian Schnabel in Dialogue with Peter Brant,"This event takes place at the Michigan Theater, 603 E Liberty St, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. Celebrated for a visual language that brings together unexpected materials and radically unconventional techniques, artist Julian Schnabel has been a pioneering, and controversial, figure since his first solo exhibition in 1979. As part of a group of 1980s artists known as Neo-Expressionists (a term that he would reject), Schnabel wanted to return to painting pre-abstraction, and forged a practice that encompassed figuration, personal narratives, and references to history and mythology. His paintings, sculptures, and works on paper have been the subject of numerous exhibitions at museums worldwide, including the current exhibition of his work at the University of Michigan Museum of Art (on view through September 27). Also a renowned filmmaker, in 1996 Schnabel wrote and directed the feature film Basquiat about artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, produced by Peter Brant. Brant Publications, Inc., is a leading art publisher whose titles include Art in America and Interview, among other important art magazines. Mr. Brant is also an entrepreneur, manufacturing executive, philanthropist, sportsman, and art collector who has a personal passion for contemporary art.

23598,A Thirty-Year Journey with Tyree Guyton and Jenenne Whitfield,"The Heidelberg Project is an outdoor art environment in the heart of an urban community on Detroit’s near-east side. The installation was started in 1986 by artist and local resident Tyree Guyton who covered abandoned houses, the street, and the surrounding area with found objects and paintings that express vivid personal, social, and sometimes political themes. The street was gradually transformed into a lively, visually arresting, and often controversial work of art that not only energized the local community but attracted visitors from around the world. Over the last three decades, the project has morphed from the work of a single artist into a broad-based collaboration between Guyton, Executive Director Jenenne Whitfield, and their team of volunteers. On the occasion of the 30-year anniversary of the Heidelberg Project, Tyree Guyton and Jenenne Whitfield look back over their dramatic journey as they contemplate new possibilities for the future. Exhibition curator MaryAnn Wilkinson will offer remarks about the exhibition at UMMA and Mr. Guyton’s work within the context of the global art community.

23823,Experiencing War in Seventeenth Century China,"The tumultuous Ming-Qing dynastic transition was one of the bloodiest and most protracted in China’s long history. Encompassing parts of eight decades and spanning the entire territory of the empire as well as the coast and neighboring lands, it affected people from all walks of life. Famine, banditry and epidemics were widespread and entire provinces devolved into armed camps as various contenders for power at all levels of the political and administrative hierarchy used and abused locals and manipulated symbols and loyalty for their own ends. Traumatic as these events were for those who experienced them, they also generated a spate of literature from official reports to diaries to memoirs that was unprecedented in Chinese history. This allows modern scholars to get a much better sense of how war was experienced and understood (or not) by both those directly affected by events and by their children and grandchildren. Focusing specifically on events associated with the Ming-Qing transition in southwest China from the 1640s-1660s, this talk will examine how people experienced war in early modern China, highlighting particular cultural responses and considering the Chinese experience in comparison with other times and places. Kenneth Swope earned his B.A. at the College of Wooster (OH) and his M.A. in Chinese Studies and Ph.D. in History at the University of Michigan.

23824,Non-Deductive Argumentation in Classical Chinese Philosophy,"One longstanding criticism of Chinese thought is that is not truly “philosophical” because it lacks viable protocols of argumentation. Thus it qualifies at best as “wisdom”; Confucius, for example, might provide valuable guidance, or thoughtful epigrams to ponder, but nothing in the way of formal reasoning that would permit his audience to reconstruct and reconsider his arguments in any conceivable context. This criticism stands only if one accepts the premise that all argumentation must be deductive argumentation. (This claim does not require any unusual definition of “deduction”; the Aristotelian definition is as good as any.) For it is true that the most famous Chinese arguments tend to be non-deductive in nature. This paper will survey the types of non-deductive argumentation commonly found in Chinese philosophy. One of the most prolific types of non-deductive argumentation is appeal to example, and this, I contend, is the basis of the strong interest in anecdotes as a genre of philosophical literature from the Springs and Autumns at least through the Six Dynasties. There are important examples of deductive argumentation as well, which will be briefly reviewed. Whether these observations are sufficient to rescue Chinese thought from the wilderness of “wisdom” and enshrine it in the halls of “philosophy” will be left for the reader to decide, but a conception of “philosophy” that can account for Chinese thought is naturally more interesting than one that cannot. Paul R. Goldin is Professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations at the University of Pennsylvania. His main research focus is Warring States China (ca. 5th-3rd centuries B.C.), with interdisciplinary interests in history,archaeology, art history, literature, philosophy, and religion.

23837,Object Lessons in Class and Class Struggle,"In Gejiu, a tin-mining town in southern Yunnan, cultural workers in the 1970s created an Exhibition on the History of Class Struggle in the Gejiu Tin Mines and a Recollect Bitterness Center. These joint exhibitions became the premier “classrooms” for class education in Yunnan province, instructing as many as a thousand visitors a day. During the 1950s, cultural workers in Gejiu had authenticated the local truth of Chinese Marxist history by displaying personal stories of capitalist exploitation, rags worn by miners in the inhumane “old society,” and drawings of worker uprisings. The exhibitions they created during the Cultural Revolution added historical reenactment as a new technique of political instruction. Historical reenactment primarily took the form of yiku (“recollecting bitterness”), narratives about oppression and liberation recited by the elderly. The practice of yiku invoked the older, powerful practice of suku (“venting grievances”), a method of class struggle during the land reforms of the 1940s and 1950s. Written renditions and live performances of yiku featured prominently in class education exhibitions, amplified by the artwork and the display of pre-liberation artifacts. This historical reenactment enjoined visitors to “learn through experience” (tihui) the exploitation, oppression, revolt, and liberation of the Chinese proletariat. The Recollect Bitterness Center even recreated the very time and space of the narrated events. Crawling through an old mine shaft and emerging upright into the light, visitors to the Center performed the metaphorical choreography of emancipation and its structure of historical memory. This instilment of perceptual knowledge about the nature of classes and the meaning of proletarian revolution produced an embodied understanding of Chinese Marxist history, interpolated new political subjects, and incited socialist construction.

23838,Material Culture and Social Order: The Monographs on Vehicles and Clothing in the Histories of the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907),"Each of the two Tang official histories contains an essay entitled ""Monograph on Vehicles and Clothing."" These prescriptive and idealizing essays list, in hierarchical order, the vehicles and costumes appropriate to each member of the government, from the royal family to the government officials to the boy who fixes the water clocks in the palace. They also describe outfits suitable for different occasions. This talk investigates the assumptions behind the monographs and compares the information we find in them to data available from other sources, such as the archaeological record, ghost stories, and poetry.

23839,Beijing Opera Costume: The Visual Communication of Character and Culture Through Clothing,"Ancient China was known as the land of impeccable attire. Dress was charged with meaning through the designations of color, cut, and embroidered symbols. Within this rank and clothing conscious context, traditional theatre costumes absorbed this language of design emphasizing garments for the identification of characters. Actors, being considered from the lower status of society, were not allowed to wear replications of actual court dress, and over generations, stage costume evolved to combine the historical motifs with theatrical expression to create a unique hybrid of dress. The costumes are conventionalized, being used consistently from troupe to troupe to communicate specific role types to the audience. The clothing in this traditional performance style does not project time period, location, or season, nor is there a costume designer responsible for devising the look of each production. Instead, each company amasses their own collection of costumes that can be used for any story, historical battles or domestic dramas, and each garment is linked to specific roles through the selection of form, fabric color, and embroidered details. Every role type can therefore be identified visually by their clothing and makeup before they utter any dialogue. The extravagantly colored and embellished costumes, along with elaborately evocative face painting and glittering headdresses, reflect the richness of the imperial courts, heightened though theatrical invention to breathtaking beauty.

23840,Beyond Belief: Portraits of Two Eminent Buddhist Monks of the Early Fifteenth Century,"Rare and distinctive portraits of the Chinese Chan Buddhist master Daoyan (1335-1418), also known as Yao Guangxiao, and of the Tibetan Buddhist master Shakya Yeshe (1354-1439) speak to the influence of Buddhism at the early Ming court, document the tangible rewards conferred on eminent Buddhist clerics by early Ming emperors, and reflect the cosmopolitan character of belief in the Ming capital cities, Nanjing and Beijing. Produced in different mediums--painting, embroidery, and tapestry (kesi)--these portraits convey the opulence of the Buddhist material culture that was created by the court for favored individuals and monasteries in China and was transmitted in various permutations beyond the Chinese frontiers through a transnational network of Buddhist monasteries that stretched eastward to Japan and westward to the Himalayas. Considered together, these very different images illuminate the use of the Buddhist art, ritual objects, and material goods in early Ming domestic politics and international relations.

23841,Mt. Wudang: The Sacred Daoist Mountain that Emperor Yongle Built,"Between the years 1412 and 1418 Emperor Yongle of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) constructed of a massive Daoist architectural complex dedicated to the Daoist deity Zhenwu on Mt. Wudang in Hubei province. When Yongle took over Mt. Wudang, the mountain range was already filled with temples dedicated to Zhenwu. These temples had been built a hundred or so years earlier by Yuan dynasty (1279-1368) priests, but by the early Ming the structures had fallen into disrepair. Emperor Yongle’s motivation to reconstruct the temples stemmed from his belief that Zhenwu had aided him in his usurpation of the throne a decade earlier. Yongle not only rebuilt dozens of temples to Zhenwu on Mt. Wudang in the new architectural style of the Ming court, including one cast in bronze for the summit of the mountain, he also sponsored the production of steles, gazetteers, woodblock prints, and painted handscrolls in order to record Zhenwu’s “auspicious responses” to his construction project. In this lecture I will investigate the many ways in which Yongle’s architectural contributions to Mt. Wudang were promoted through these various mediums. I argue that Yongle was successful in rebranding the sacred site of Mt. Wudang as a product of his own creation, despite the fact that he relied almost entirely on the preexisting temple configurations and meanings when constructing it.

Yet turning an organization positive is a most difficult challenge. Relationships, teams, organizations and communities are governed by conventional cultures that naturally resist positive change. In this presentation Bob will draw tools from his new book, The Positive Organization. The audience will have the opportunity to use the tools in real time, and create their own practical paths to positive organizing. ROBERT E. QUINN holds the Margaret Elliot Tracey Collegiate Professorship at the University of Michigan and serves on the faculty of Organization and Management at Michigan Ross. He is one of the co-founders of the Center for Positive Organizations. Quinn’s research and teaching focus on leadership, organizational change and effectiveness. He has published 18 books on these subjects. His best-selling book, Deep Change has sold over 100,000 copies. His book, The Best Teacher in You won the Ben Franklin Award designating it the best book in education for 2015. His latest book is The Positive Organization: Breaking Free of Conventional Cultures, Constraints and Beliefs. He is particularly known for his work on the competing values framework.

SESSION DESCRIPTION: What do we know, and what do we not yet know about the effects of the ""positive"" in organizations and on individuals? Positive leadership can and does have powerful, generative effects in organizations. At the same time, there are some important criticisms and critiques associated with ""the positive"". Some criticize the research. Some criticize the practice.

Kahn Distinguished University Professor of Business Administration and Psychology at Michigan Ross SESSION DESCRIPTION: Organizations are fundamentally patterns of interrelating, reinforced by structures and work processes. It's no wonder they are hard to change. In this presentation, Brandeis University Professor Jody Hoffer Gittell will introduce relational coordination as a tool for both research and practice. She will share live case studies illustrating how organizations use relational coordination principles and measures as tools for change, and then conclude with a Relational Model for Organizational Change. JODY HOFFER GITTELL, PhD, is a professor at Brandeis University's Heller School for Social Policy and Management, and a leading expert on relational coordination and organizational performance. She founded the Relational Coordination Research Collaborative, bringing scholars and practitioners together to help organizations build relational coordination for high performance. She co-founded a university spinoff called Relational Coordination Analytics Inc., offering measurement and intervention support to organizations seeking to improve their performance, and serves as its Chief Scientific Officer. Gittell's research explores how workers, leaders, and customers contribute to quality and efficiency outcomes through their coordination with each other. She has developed a theory of relational coordination, proposing that highly interdependent work is most effectively coordinated through relationships of shared goals, shared knowledge, and mutual respect supported by frequent, timely, accurate, and problem-solving rather than blaming communication. Research demonstrates that relational coordination is associated with a wide range of performance outcomes, and that organizations can support it through the design of their work systems. The RC survey, a validated instrument that is widely used for research as well as practice, assesses dynamics among participants and opens up dialogues to foster fundamental organizational change. In The Southwest Airlines Way: Using the Power of Relationships to Achieve High Performance(McGraw-Hill), and in High Performance Healthcare: Using the Power of Relationships to Achieve Quality, Efficiency and Resilience (McGraw-Hill), Gittell describes how relational coordination drives performance in airlines and in healthcare, and how organizations support - or undermine - its development. In Up In the Air: How the Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging Their Employees (Cornell University Press), co-authored with Bamber, Kochan and von Nordenflycht, she analyzes the transformation of the global airline industry in response to low cost competition. Sociology of Organizations: Structures and Relationships (Sage Publications) brings together classic and new authors to show how structures and relationships enable organizations to address their most basic challenges. Her newest book, Relational Coordination: Transforming Relationships for High Performance (Stanford University Press) demonstrates how relational, work process, and structural interventions work together synergistically to enable organizations to achieve sustainable systemic change. Gittell has published her research in scientific journals such as Academy of Management Review, Organization Science, Management Science, Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, Journal of Organizational Behavior, Journal of Service Research, Journal of Management Studies, Human Resource Management, Human Resource Management Journal, International Journal of Human Resource Management, Industrial and Labor Relations Review, Harvard Business Review, California Management Review, Medical Care, Health Services Research, Health Care Management Review, Journal of Nursing Management, and Journal of Early Childhood Research. Gittell has won a Best Book Award from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a Best Paper award from the Human Resource Division of the Academy of Management, the Douglas McGregor Memorial Award for Best Paper of the Year in the Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, and an Honorable Mention for the Douglas McGregor Memorial Award for Best Paper on Organizational Change. She was selected Outstanding Young Scholar of the Year by the Labor and Employment Relations Association. Gittell received her PhD from the MIT Sloan School of Management, her MA from The New School and her BA from Reed College, and taught for six years at the Harvard Business School before joining the faculty of Brandeis University. She has served as Chair of the Board for Families First Health and Support Center, as MBA Program Director at the Brandeis Heller School, and as Acting Director of the MIT Leadership Center. She now serves on the boards of the Labor and Employment Relations Association and the Endowment for Health, and on the editorial board for the Academy of Management Review. She lives in Portsmouth, New Hampshire with her husband Ross and their daughters Rose and Grace. Positive Links sessions take place at Michigan Ross, and are free and open to the public.

Kahn Distinguished University Professor of Business Administration and Psychology at Michigan Ross SESSION DESCRIPTION: Successful innovations begin as creative ideas, but generating good ideas is only half the battle. Leaders must also be able to identify the most promising ideas when they see them. Too often, bold new ideas are unwisely rejected. Based on recent research, this session will explore tools and strategies to help leaders become more accurate judges of novel ideas, improving their ability to spot the best ideas in their organizations.

She will also consider the diverse ways in which the developments of the 1990s—the ongoing culture wars, issues of artistic freedom and censorship, the impact of new media, and the increase of artists of color, women artists, and LGBT artists—redefined contemporary approaches to artistic practice and, in her words, “writes a history of the ’90s through the lens of the visual arts.” Alexandra Schwartz is the founding Curator of Contemporary Art at the Montclair Art Museum. Previously she was a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, where her exhibitions included Mind and Matter: Alternative Abstractions, 1940s to Now and Modern Women: Single Channel at MoMA PS1. She is the author of Ed Ruscha’s Los Angeles (MIT Press, 2010). An editor and contributor to numerous publications, Schwartz has taught at Columbia University and the University of Michigan, and in the Education Departments at MoMA and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

25166,EXCEL roundtable discussion: New Media Strategies for Music Distribution,"This roundtable discussion tackles a series of concerns facing musicians, composers, and producers in the 21st century. First and foremost, it considers how innovative technologies and continually evolving social networks have changed the international field of music production and distribution, while simultaneously shifting audience expectations and attitudes concerning music consumption. Secondly, it engages one of the fundamental questions any modern musician must ask – should I give my music away for free? This panel contrasts some of the personal and professional pros and cons related to this decision, particularly by drawing on the insights and experiences of local indie label director Jeremy Peters (Ghostly International – ghostly.com), and non-commercial Chilean netlabel directors and artists in residence, Mika Martini (pueblonuevo.cl) and Pablo Flores (jacobinodiscos.cl). Finally, as a key issue indelibly tied to all these concerns, this panel will also address questions related to intellectual property rights, with special consideration given to Creative Commons licensing platforms as an alternative to traditional copyright protections. This roundtable will conclude with an opportunity for audience questions and comments, with the hope of stirring a lively conversation. Panelists include Christi-Anne Castro PhD, associate professor of Ethnomusicology/director of Southeast Asian Studies; Pablo Flores – director of Jacobino Discos Netlabel (Santiago, Chile); Mika Martini – director of Pueblo Nuevo Netlabel (Santiago, Chile); Jeremy Peters – director of Independent Music Label Ghostly International (Ann Arbor) More info: http://music.umich.edu/excelrsvp",Map Earl V.

In this lecture, Hanninen sets out to develop a theory for the kinesthetic analysis of musical movement that attends not only to the complex choreography of precise physical actions suggested by Western music notation, but to intentional aspects and felt qualities of motion from a first-person perspective. Throughout the lecture, she considers some of the fundamental challenges of doing this work, which include problems of ontology, language, and research methods.",Map Earl V. Moore Building - Glenn E.

For too long have world leaders failed to take meaningful action on climate change. For too long has the state of Michigan lagged behind the rest of the country on meaningful climate action and justice. Climate change affects us all, and impacts people in poverty and people of color most. This is not acceptable. We need to transition to a clean energy state and protect those most vulnerable. This year is critical for creating a fair and sustainable future. As world leaders come together from 195 countries to Paris, they will be negotiating how to stop climate change and how to transition to a fossil-free world. Let's tell Michigan to do the same. We have marched through the streets of Detroit, demanding justice. We won't stop until we have it. Now we will march through Ann Arbor, demanding a just transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050. Climate change affects us all, and that's why we're calling on each and every one of you to come march with us and tell the state of Michigan to lead the way. We will gather in front of the Federal Building in Ann Arbor, march through downtown and the university's campus, ending with a rally on the Diag, where there will be refreshments to keep you warm.

With the arrival of the British in North America, the two colonial systems produce contrasting societies that come in conflict as Manifest Destiny pushes the U.S into the Mexican territories of the South West. Through the Mexican American War, the U.S. takes a full half of Mexico's territory by 1848. Over seventy thousand Mexicans are caught in a strange land and many become American citizens. As the Gold Rush floods California with settlers, complex and vital communities are overwhelmed. Mexicans and Mexican Americans are treated as second-class citizens, facing discrimination and racial violence. Resistance to this injustice appears in New Mexico as Las Gorras Blancas (The White Caps), burn Anglo ranches and cut through barbed wire to prevent Anglo encroachment. At the same time, New Mexicans manage to transform themselves through education, managing to preserve Hispano culture in New Mexico and their standing in the midst of an era of conquest and dispossession.",Off Campus Location - Ann Arbor Downtown District Library - Multi-Purpose Room,"['2016-01-18 18:30', '2016-01-20 18:30']","['Culture', 'Discussion', 'Film', 'Free', 'History', 'Latin america', 'Spanish studies']"

HOSTED BY: Gretchen Spreitzer, the Faculty Co-Director at the Center for Positive Organizations; the Keith E. and Valerie J. Alessi Professor of Business Administration; and Professor of Management and Organizations at Michigan Ross. SESSION DESCRIPTION: Do you want to know why most people don’t stay motivated to practice healthy behaviors (exercise, dietary change, etc.), even when they deeply want to? In this presentation, Michelle presents research explaining why the traditional approach to promoting healthy behaviors sets employees and patients up for short-term rather than sustainable behavior. Integrating behavioral science with positive organizational scholarship, she will explain how sustainable behavior change, personal well-being, and organizational thriving can result from reframing “healthy choices” and self-care with “The Right Whys” (e.g., vitality). Come to this session if you want to learn a new science- and practice-based approach for motivating and maintaining healthy behaviors among individuals that concurrently fosters outcomes that organizations desire. MICHELLE SEGAR, PhD, MPH, author of “No Sweat! How the Simple Science of Motivation Can Bring You a Lifetime of Fitness” (AMACOM 2015), directs the University of Michigan’s Sport, Health, and Activity Research and Policy Center (SHARP) and is a Faculty Associate at the Michigan Ross Center for Positive Organizations. She is widely quoted in the media and consulted as an expert by publications like The New York Times and government agencies. Her first book, ""No Sweat"", was chosen as the #1 book in Diet/Exercise in 2015 by the USA Best Book Awards, and when released, it became the #1 Exercise & Fitness book on Amazon. Michelle advises global organizations on new methods that foster the consistent decision making that underlie a lifetime of meaning, well-being, and health, with a focus on creating patient-centered systems and employee health and well-being. Her 360-degree perspective is informed by over twenty years of award-winning research, consulting, and individual health coaching, uniquely positioning her to help organizations understand and leverage the emotional drivers and internal rewards of peoples’ health decisions.

Connect with our community of academics, students, staff, and leaders at our receptions that immediately follow each session. HOSTED BY: Jane Dutton, the Robert L. Kahn Distinguished University Professor of Business Administration and Psychology at Michigan Ross SESSION DESCRIPTION: How do individuals and organizations learn from success? While it sounds easy, it is not. And yet, learning from success is a critical component of what makes organizations positive. University of Louisville College of Business Associate Professor Ryan Quinn explores the opportunities and challenges of this kind of learning. Quinn shares research that helps us see what works and guides the audience with tools designed to facilitate learning from success. By using tools like these, we can create new possibilities for ourselves and our organizations, and never stop getting better. RYAN QUINN is an Associate Professor at the University of Louisville’s College of Business. He researches, teaches, trains, and consults on topics related to leadership and change management. He teaches in the Full-Time, Professional, Weekend and Executive MBA programs, and has also taught in Executive Education and undergraduate programs. He has consulted around the world for Fortune 500 companies, private firms, start-up businesses, non-profits, and government institutions, and is a principal at Lift Consulting. He has also been involved in educational consulting and training, including his involvement in the Darden/Curry Partnership for Leaders in Education’s Turnaround Specialist program and Wallace Foundation program, helping to train school system administrators to transform public schools and reduce achievement gaps. Ryan’s research focuses on two topics in particular: (1) the role that our psychological states play in our leadership, and (2) how organizations and individuals learn from success. Ryan has a B.S. in statistics from Brigham Young University, a Ph.D. in Management and Organizations from Michigan Ross, a graduate certificate in the study of complex systems from the University of Michigan, and has studied international business and corporate strategy in Hitotsubashi University in Japan. He has taught at the Olin School of Business in Washington University in St. Louis, the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia, and the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University. Ryan has also been heavily involved in the Positive Organizational Scholarship movement, focusing many of his research questions on understanding what makes organizations and the people within them flourish, excel, and exceed expectations. Ryan has published articles in outlets such as Administrative Science Quarterly, Academy of Management Review, Academy of Management Annals, Organization Science, Human Resource Management, Journal of Management, Business & Economy, and The Washington Post. The second edition of the award-winning book he co-authored with his father, Lift: The Fundamental State of Leadership (Berrett-Koehler) will be published in the summer of 2015.

HOSTED BY: Gretchen Spreitzer, the Faculty Co-Director at the Center for Positive Organizations; the Keith E. and Valerie J. Alessi Professor of Business Administration; and Professor of Management and Organizations at Michigan Ross. SESSION DESCRIPTION: Want to make a difference in your organization? In this session, Jerry Davis and Chris White (authors of Changing Your Company From the Inside Out) will provide a framework for advancing the initiatives that are important to you, your company, and the world. JERRY DAVIS received his Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University and taught at Northwestern and Columbia before moving to the University of Michigan, where he is the Wilbur K. Pierpont Collegiate Professor of Management and of Sociology. He has published widely in management, sociology, and finance. Books include Social Movements and Organization Theory (Cambridge University Press, 2005); Organizations and Organizing (Pearson Prentice Hall, 2007); Managed by the Markets: How Finance Reshaped America (Oxford University Press, 2009); Changing your Company from the Inside Out: A Guide for Social Intrapreneurs (Harvard Business Review Press, 2015); and The Decline and Fall of the American Corporation (Berrett-Koehler, forthcoming). He is Editor of the Administrative Science Quarterly and Director of the Interdisciplinary Committee on Organization Studies (ICOS) at the University of Michigan. Davis’s research is broadly concerned with the effects of finance on society. Recent writings examine how ideas about corporate social responsibility have evolved to meet changes in the structures and geographic footprint of multinational corporations; whether ""shareholder capitalism"" is still a viable model for economic development; how income inequality in an economy is related to corporate size and structure; why theories about organizations do (or do not) progress; how architecture shapes social networks and innovation in organizations; why stock markets spread to some countries and not others; and whether there exist viable organizational alternatives to shareholder-owned corporations in the United States. CHRIS WHITE leads the Center for Positive Organizations at The University of Michigan. The Center helps leaders build high-performing organizations that bring out the best in people through ground-breaking research, educational programs and organizational partnerships. The Center won the 2012 Research Center Impact Award from The Academy of Management. At the Ross School of Business, Chris co-developed and teaches the MBA class on Social Intrapreneurship, which has since been replicated in other top business schools. He also teaches in the Executive Education program on selling internally. Chris is co-author of Changing Your Company From the Inside Out: A Guide for Social Intrapreneurs (Harvard Business Review Press, 2015). Chris has been leading and consulting to purpose-driven organizations for 15 years. His career has spanned the non-profit, corporate, and philanthropic sectors. His work has been featured by outlets including Fast Company, Inc., Forbes, CBS, The Huffington Post, and Talent Management Magazine.

27237,Penny Stamps Speaker Series Presents: Andrea Zittel,"Andrea Zittel's sculptures and installations transform everything necessary for life — eating, sleeping, bathing, and socializing — into artful experiments in living. Blurring the lines between life and art, Zittel's projects extend to her own home and wardrobe. Wearing a single outfit every day for an entire season, and constantly remodeling her home to suit changing demands and interests, Zittel continually reinvents her relationship to her domestic and social environment. Influenced by Modernist design and architecture from the early twentieth century, the artist's one-woman mock organization, A–Z Administrative Services, develops furniture, homes, and vehicles for contemporary consumers with a similar simplicity and attention to order. Seeking to attain a sense of freedom through structure, Zittel is more interested in revealing the human need for order than in prescribing a single unifying design principle or style. Zittel's work has been exhibited internationally in galleries, museums, and biennales including the New Museum of Contemporary Art (NYC), the Museum of Contemporary Art (CA), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (CA), Museum of Modern Art, Guggenheim Museum (NYC), and the Whitney Museum of American Art among others. She is also co-organizer of High Desert Test Sites, a non-profit that supports experimental art projects in the Joshua Tree region.","Michigan Theater (603 E Liberty St. Ann Arbor, MI 48108)",['2016-03-24 17:10'],"['Art', 'Discussion', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Free', 'Lecture']"
27238,Penny Stamps Speaker Series Presents: Vik Muniz,"Vik Muniz repurposes everyday materials such as chocolate, ash, dirt, peanut butter, and jelly to create intricate and heavily layered trompe l'oeil renderings, often of iconic artworks. Muniz's highly-constructed works are not only “legible” on various levels but also call attention to their own legibility, conveying an image without concealing the language — or rather, the linguistics — of the image conveyed. In 2008, he undertook a large-scale project in Brazil, photographing trash-pickers as figures from emblematic paintings, such as Jacques-Louis David's Neoclassical Death of Marat, and then recreating the photographs in large-scale arrangements of trash. The project was documented in the 2010 film Waste Land in an attempt to raise awareness for urban poverty. Muniz's distinctive practice explores and revels in the instability that exists between craft and mechanical reproduction, between high art and popular culture, between the ephemeral and the perdurable, between the coded and the recognizable. Muniz has been featured in numerous solo exhibitions, including Art Museum of Banco de la República (Bogotá), Beyeler Foundation, P.S. 1 MoMA (NYC), the Pinacoteca do Estado de São Paulo (São Paulo), MACRO (Rome), the Irish Museum of Modern Art (Dublin), and the Menil Collection (Houston), and his work is included in major private and public collections around the world.","Michigan Theater (603 E Liberty St. Ann Arbor, MI 48108)",['2016-03-31 17:10'],"['Art', 'Discussion', 'Education', 'Free', 'Lecture', 'Visual arts']"

27390,Carrigan Lecture Series in Music Theory: Maryam Moshavar,"Maryam Moshavar’s research focuses on the history of music theory and its intersections with philosophy and aesthetics, the interfaces of music and poetry, and phenomenology. In his 1748 “Memoir on Mathematical Subjects” Diderot asks whether the soul can be “secretly guided” by the perception of rapports between musical sounds, and be influenced in its aesthetic judgments by “a kind of secret and natural trigonometry.” The subject of the sensory perception of rapports, in part reminiscent of Jean-Philippe Rameau’s contested claims about the geometrical affinities of the musical ear, is one that brings together a cross-current of epistemologies of rationalist as well as empiricist origin. In question, from an empiricist standpoint, is the ontological and epistemological status of abstraction and geometric figuration in perception, and the possibility, as Alain Cernuschi (2000) has pointed out, of envisioning a correlation between the object of perception (the object of physico-mathematical observation) and the object of reflection in which sonorous musical events are constituted. Though the question of the perception of rapports in the sensory domain, and the impact of such perceptions on aesthetic and musical experience is a lingering one in Diderot’s writings, d’Alembert’s verdict, hidden in the 1752 edition of his Elémens de musique but emerging to the forefront in the preamble to Volume VI of the Encyclopédie in 1756, appears definitive and without appeal. In this paper, Moshavar returns to the public face of d’Alembert’s refutation that brings Rameau’s principle of the fundamental bass to a checkmate from the standpoint not just of its physics, but also of its practice and aesthetics, and consider the conception of music theory that is left behind, from the “point of view,” in d’Alembert’s words, “under which science envisions its object.”",Map Earl V.

27561,Positive Links Speaker Series,"(Registration link under ""Web and Social"" at the bottom the page) Gain inspiring and practical research-based strategies for building organizations that are high performing and bring out the best in people. Join us at the Positive Links Speaker Series to learn from leading Positive Organizational scholars. Connect with our community of academics, students, staff, and leaders at our receptions that immediately follow each session. HOSTED BY: Gretchen Spreitzer, the Faculty Co-Director at the Center for Positive Organizations; the Keith E. and Valerie J. Alessi Professor of Business Administration; and Professor of Management and Organizations at Michigan Ross SESSION DESCRIPTION: The prevailing wisdom on crisis management is that crises and their aftermaths are best addressed by a small team of people that carefully manages and controls information and that operates with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. In this session, Davis-Blake will explore the recovery of the Ross School of Business from a significant crisis that included strategic, financial, and academic elements. By inverting the rules of crisis management (e.g., sharing information widely, including many people, allowing roles and responsibilities to be emergent), the Ross School achieved seemingly impossible results. Davis-Blake will explore the potential generalizability of the case of the Ross School to other organizations. ALISON DAVIS-BLAKE is the Edward J. Frey Dean of the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. She is also the Stephen M. Ross Professor of Business. Davis-Blake is a higher education leader at the forefront of developing, promoting, and implementing positive business practices and foreseeing the changing educational and workplace needs of the next generation of business leaders. Upon becoming dean of Michigan Ross in July 2011, the first female dean in the school’s history, Davis-Blake brought a new focus and mission to the school: to develop leaders who make a positive difference in the world. Her belief that business can be economically prosperous and a force for good has resonated with students from around the world who desire to study at Ross, one of the top business schools in the country, and to learn how to develop and lead companies that create value for both shareholders and society. Davis-Blake is building on Ross’ prestige and tradition of excellence to position the school as a leader in lifelong business education through analytic rigor, a boundaryless approach to learning, action-oriented lessons inside and outside of the classroom, and the school’s global leadership position in positive business education. As dean at Ross, Davis-Blake has led academic innovations including reframing undergraduate business education through a new BBA curriculum focused on preparing millennial learners for the jobs of tomorrow, the creation of a new Master of Management Program, and expanding the top-ranked Executive MBA Program to Los Angeles. Under her leadership, Ross has experienced global growth, with expanded activities in India, China, Southeast Asia, and a living business model in Africa. As the dean of a top global business school, Davis-Blake has increased international learning opportunities for students by 89 percent and formed 17 new partnerships with universities around the world. Her efforts to expand the breadth of faculty thought leadership have resulted in 25 tenure-track faculty members and 30 lecturers, constituting 27% of the teaching faculty at the school. During her time as dean, Ross has been recognized by Bloomberg Businessweek as having the highest proportion of female faculty who are tenured or on the road to tenure of any top 10 business school and the highest percentage of tenured women professors. During Davis-Blake’s deanship, Ross will raise more than $400 million in private support to advance academics, scholarship, and faculty research; and complete the business campus of the future, spearheaded by a $100 million gift from Stephen M. Ross in 2013, one of the largest single donations to a business school in history. Davis-Blake is a recognized thought leader, with media outlets throughout the world including the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Businessweek, The Guardian, South China Morning Post, Crain’s, and others seeking her perspective on the future of business education, positive business, educational trends, leadership and more. Prior to joining Ross in 2011, Davis-Blake was dean of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota from 2006 to 2011, where she was also the first female dean. From 1990 to 2006, Davis-Blake was a member of the faculty and senior associate dean at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas (Austin), and prior to that she was a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University’s business school. Davis-Blake is an expert on strategic human resource management and organizational design. She obtained her PhD in organizational behavior from Stanford University and her undergraduate and master's degrees from Brigham Young University. Davis-Blake is married and has two sons. She is a native of St. Paul, Minn. Positive Links sessions take place at Michigan Ross, and are free and open to the public. Most sessions are live-streamed via a link from our Events page.

Dr. Dhar will present key insights from her monograph Violence, Knowledge and the Female Body: Interrogating Rape Narratives; a forthcoming co-edited volume Education in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Islands; as well as an article on feminist theory, comparative religion, and love. Dr. Dhar’s transdisciplinary research explores, though the lens of gender, the intersections between disciplines, epistemic frames, theory and praxis, in order to ask critical questions pertaining to gender, sexual violence, and education. The talk will interrogate how hegemonic understandings of “bodies” — seen in terms of both gender and knowledge — frame and mediate national and transnational initiatives on sexual violence and education. Dr. Dhar is particularly interested in situating these initiatives within the difficult dialogues between “the east” and “the west,” in light of past and present colonial practices, to examine the possibilities and limitations of love as a (feminist) method. This event is free and open to the public. Please feel free to bring your lunch.

Unlike static approaches (i.e., cell surface makers, genetic phenotypes) used to guide precision medicine in cancer, the dynamic changes that occur during critical illness and injury over multiple echelons of care demand the development of data capture, integration, and analytics capable of promoting rapid clinical decision making within minutes to hours. We will describe current challenges and approaches to develop data-in-motion phenotyping solutions that may allow continuous predictive early warning and trajectory monitoring for clinical decision making that span from the Intensive Care Unit to the home and beyond.

When José Ortega y Gasset diagnosed the new literature, music, and painting of the post-World War I generation as an art of “dehumanization,” he celebrated Claude Debussy as a formative example. But what did this slogan actually mean? The question can be answered in part by considering the mode of aesthetic engagement Ortega called “outward concentration” (concentración hacia afuera), drawing upon sources in early phenomenology.",Map Earl V.

Please visit fordschool.umich.edu on the day of the event for viewing access information. Join the conversation: #policytalks Ferguson, Cleveland, Baltimore, Chicago ... Cities across America are in crisis, grappling with the need to enact meaningful reforms in the wake of a growing spotlight on the use of deadly force by police officers. Cincinnati, once synonymous with broken policing, has been put forward as model for reform in all of these cities and more--thanks to more than a decade of hard, sustained work by a broad array of community organizations, police leaders, federal officials, academics, and many others. We've convened a discussion with some of the key participants in Cincinnati’s reforms. With others, they worked together to develop and implement the new approach to policing that has garnered such national attention. They'll be joined by a leader from the Detroit Police Department for reflections on what the lessons of Cincinnati might hold for communities here in Southeast Michigan and elsewhere. Panelists: Rev. Damon Lynch III, New Prospect Baptist Church, Cincinnati, OH. Community activist and former President of the Cincinnati Black United Front, which led the class action lawsuit against the Cincinnati Police Department. James Whalen, former Assistant Chief, Cincinnati Police Department. Public Safety Director, University of Cincinnati. Saul A. Green (BA '69, JD '72), independent federal monitor who oversaw implementation of the Cincinnati reforms. Litigation and Trial Group, Miller Canfield.

28985,Neue Leben,"Ingo Schulze is the author of 'Simple Stories' and 'Neue Leben', both of which thematize the process of German reunification (“Wende”) from a deliberately provincial, East German perspective. Schulze grew up in Dresden and studied classical philology at the University of Jena. He worked as a Dramaturg for the theater in Altenburg and as a journalist for the short-lived Altenburger Wochenblatt (1990-91) that he co-founded. Both 'Neue Leben' and his subsequent novel 'Adam und Evelyn' were finalists for the German Book Prize in 2006 and 2008, respectively. The recipient of a fellowship at the Villa Massimo in Rome, Schulze published a collection of stories entitled 'Orangen und Engel: Italienische Skizzen', which appeared in 2010. He has taught at the University of Lüneburg (as a Heinrich-Heine-Gastdozent), written a prize-winning radio feature (Das Deutschlandgerät) and won numerous literary awards, including the Peter-Weiss Prize, the Thüringer Literaturpreis, the Bertolt-Brecht Prize. Described by the New York Times as a “mordant comedy,” Ingo Schulze’s 2005 novel 'Neue Leben' presents the story of Enrico Türmer, a young man who becomes caught up in the transition from East German socialism to capitalism in a unified Germany after 1989. Türmer, a failed writer in the GDR, becomes an entrepreneur in the new Germany. Presented as a series of letters written by Türmer to his lover, his brother, and his sister (and annotated with footnotes by one Ingo Schulze), the novel is both a historical document and an experiment in epistolary form. As one reviewer poignantly put it, the novel tells the story of how the East and the West became lost to one another after 1989. The reading will be in German, with copies available in English.

Or so we are told. But if we look in odd places—in the comedies of Shakespeare, and in one or two of his tragedies—we may find that a few concepts crucial to modern political theory receive sustained attention. This lecture will consider two of them briefly, and one at length.""

The remaining 95% is made up of a recipe of 25% dark matter and 70% dark energy, both nonluminous components whose nature remains a mystery. Professor Freese will recount the hunt for dark matter, from the discoveries of visionary scientists like Fritz Zwicky, the Swiss astronomer who coined the term ""dark matter"" in 1933, to the deluge of data today from underground laboratories, satellites in space, and the Large Hadron Collider. She will provide an overview of this cosmic cocktail, including the evidence for the existence of dark matter in galaxies.

29716,"“flip. peasant. spanish.: Gender, Defective Spanish, and Linguistic Incapacity in the Comparative US-Mexican-Philippine Borderlands”","Drawing on comparative ethnic studies, this paper examines the comparative affinities between Chicana/o and Filipina/o racialization in the US-Mexico Borderlands through a postcolonial disability optic. By including the Philippines as a borderlands where US transpacific imperialism and Spanish colonialism have historically overlapped – the very same colonial projects that have informed the various formations of the US-Mexican corridor – I propose a re-consideration of the border as an “herida abierta”, as iconized by Gloria Anzaldúa, as a Chicana disability theory that helps to explain the comparartive racializations of Filipino postcoloniality. Through a consideration of Brian Ascalon Roley’s Filipino-Chicano novel, American Son (2001), alongside Borderlands/La Frontera, I develop the concept “linguistic incapacity” to examine the vulnerabilities of linguistic colonialism and the racial embodiments and defects of language. I use Anzaldúa canonical chapter, “How to Tame a Wild Tongue”, which proposes the liberation and maintenance of defective disabled Spanishes (“somos las del español deficiente), as a lens to understand American Son’s representations of wounded “castrated” Filipino masculinities within a US-Mexican borderscape. I interpose the critiques of “racial castration” of Asian American queer studies alongside the wounded tongues of Chicana feminist theory to suggest that in American Son the disability of castration is rehabilitated through the mixed-race mis-recognition of Filipinos as Latinos in a US racial imaginary. The “castrated mestizo” represents the intersection of Chicano and Filipino embodiment. I attempt to understand the polysemous Filipino body, whose provenance is a “Hispanic Asia”, through the optic of Chicana feminist theory. This inevitably leads me to the question of “Flip Spanish” - a “wild tongue” that is not characterized by the preservation of anomalous Spanish but rather through its absent presence, a condition I term “linguistic incapacity”. What can absence, linguistic defect, and language deficits tell us about the comparative racial projects of US imperialism? What can the “racial errors” of misrecognition bring to disability theory? Finally, what can comparative ethnic studies gain from expanding its modes of inquiry to include disability? What does comparative Filipina/o and Latina/o scholarship look like?",Map Haven Hall - 3773,['2016-03-25 12:00'],['Free']
29721,Ford Motor Company Distinguished Lecture in Physics,"Dr. H. Eugene Stanley William Fairfield Warren Distinguished Professor; Director, Center for Polymer Studies; Professor of Physics, Chemistry, Biomedical Engineering, and Physiology (School of Medicine) Boston University Lecture Abstract: Dr. H. Eugene Stanley will introduce some of the 73 documented anomalies of the most complex of liquids, water—focusing on recent progress in understanding these anomalies by combining information provided by recent experiments and simulations on water designed to test the hypothesis that liquid water has behavior consistent with the novel phenomenon of “liquid polymorphism” in that water can exist in two distinct phases. He will also discuss very recent work on nanoconfined water anomalies as well as the apparently related, and highly unusual, behavior of water in biological environments. Finally, Dr. Stanley will discuss how the general concept of liquid polymorphism is proving useful in understanding anomalies in other liquids, such as silicon and silica, as well as metallic glasses, which have in common that they are characterized by two characteristic length scales in their interactions.",Map Lorch Hall - 140,['2016-03-23 16:15'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk']"

After witnessing a woman drowning, Elisio can’t sleep. His friend, Fadoul, discovers a bag full of money that could change their life. Enter Absolut, a blind exotic dancer, who takes a liking to Fadoul. Crazy (or is she?) Frau Habersatt, a former librarian living on the edge, begs forgiveness for acts she never committed. Franz has finally found employment and meaning in life, caring for the dead. His wife, Rosa, would like to have a child but Franz’ tendency to bring his work home with him and the fact that Rosa’s mother, Frau Zucker, a feisty communist with a colorful past, has moved into their tiny apartment makes intimacy impossible. Ella, an aging philosopher, has burned all of her publications with the exception of one: The Unreliability of the World. The President is ever-present in every household, giving speeches that have nothing and everything to do with these characters’ lives.

30059,Film Screening: Mestiza Music,"Western classical music, traditionally known for scores that go back as far as 1000 AD, is a genre that is still being written today. Modern composers continue to develop new ways to present a style that is centuries old. Symphony orchestras are starting to make room for new instruments in their ensembles. For one North American composer, multi-cultural fusion within the classical world has become a passionate mission to create mestiza (mixed-race) music. Grammy-winning Peruvian-American composer Gabriela Lena Frank recently brought her unique music-making process to the University of Michigan for an experiment: After years of planning, musicians with roots in Finland, Korea, China and the United States, join three talented Ecuadorian panpipe players in Ann Arbor, to premiere a new rendition of Mestiza Music. The film is produced by WFYI-Indianapolis with support from the U-M Office of Research, the School of Music, Theater and Dance, and the Residential College, and filmed during a visiting artist residency at U-M in the fall of 2014. The screening will be accompanied by a question and answer session with the composer Gabriela Lena Frank, filmmaker Aric Hartvig and performers Andrew Jennings (violin) and Katri Ervamaa (cello). A reception to follow. Watch the trailer here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8jldNI5NmA",Map East Quadrangle - Residential College- Keene Auditorium,['2016-04-04 16:00'],"['Free', 'Music']"

The women interviewed include Jarrar’s aunt, a seamstress from Nablus, former students, and current artistic collaborators and colleagues. Song texts are adapted from the interviews, weaving together their different voices, perspectives and experiences in a way that challenges current existing media stereotypes of Palestinian culture and womanhood, specifically, through the portrayal of universal themes within a larger global context. The result is a sonic and visual exploration of personal experiences with place in relation to transnational intersectional feminist perspectives on the self/denial of the self, the state, personal identity, the body, sociality and agency.",Map Duderstadt Center (Media Union) - Video Studio,"['2016-04-07 20:00', '2016-04-08 20:00']","['Free', 'North campus', 'Theater']"

30379,April in Paris: Life Sciences Orchestra concert,"If you can’t make it to Paris this spring, the U-M Life Sciences Orchestra will offer the next best thing on Sunday, April 24. And best of all, it’s free. The LSO, joined by a range of talented soloists, will perform a French-themed concert that includes the entire first act of Giacomo Puccini’s beloved opera La Bohème, set in Paris, as well as French composer Francis Poulenc’s Organ Concerto and George Gershwin’s An American in Paris. The concert will begin at 4 p.m. in U-M’s famous Hill Auditorium, is open to all with general admission seating. No tickets are required. The LSO is made up of dozens of members of the U-M medical and scientific community, and the concert will conclude the orchestra’s 16th season of blending science and music. Music director Roberto Kalb will give a pre-concert talk at 3:15 p.m. in the lower level of the building to help audience members get the most out of the performance. Opera for all For the concert-style performance of La Bohème’s most upbeat act, Kalb will lead the LSO and vocal soloists to evoke the story of Parisian bohemians in the 1830s. In addition to his role with the LSO, Kalb is an experienced opera conductor, both at U-M and the Opera Theatre of St. Louis. The lively and witty lyrics, sung in Italian, will be projected in English, making the performance accessible even to those who have never seen an opera. The vocal talent assembled for the performance includes up-and-coming singers Ann Toomey as Mimi, Joshua Wheeker as Rodolfo, Zachary Crowle as Marcello, Michael Miller as Schaunard, and Glenn Healy as Colline. Special guest Stephen West, chair of the Department of Voice at the U-M School of Music, Theatre & Dance, will sing the part of the bohemians’ landlord Benoit. The concert’s second half will begin with Poulenc’s moving piece for organ, strings and timpani, composed in the 1930s. Soloist Naki Sung Kripfgans, a prominent organist and winner of the LSO Concerto Competition, will perform on Hill Auditorium’s legendary Frieze Memorial Organ. The performance will conclude with Gershwin’s Jazz Age masterpiece, a symphonic poem that traces the adventures of an American strolling through the city -- and feeling homesick as well. As the composer intended, the percussion section will include a set of authentic Paris taxi horns, which will be played in accordance with new recommendations from U-M musicologist and Gershwin Initiative leader Mark Clague about the notes these horns should play. (Read more here: http://umhealth.me/gershhorn) The LSO is made up of medical, health and science faculty, staff, students and alumni from across U-M, and is led by Kalb with assistant conductor Jacobsen Woollen. Kalb holds the Gilbert S. Omenn, M.D. Music Director position with the LSO, made possible by a gift from its namesake, the first U-M executive vice president for medical affairs and a longtime supporter of the LSO. Kalb and Woollen are both graduate students in the U-M School of Music, Theatre & Dance’s nationally known orchestral conducting program, from which the LSO has drawn its conductors for its entire 16 years of blending science and music. The orchestra is part of the Gifts of Art program, which brings the world of art and music to the U-M Health System. The LSO gives members an outlet for their musical talents and a chance to interact with one another across academic disciplines and professions. Founded by students and staff from the U-M Health System, the orchestra made its concert debut in January 2001.

Shot by an array of professional photographers, these often striking documentary images were a novel strategy for conveying information—showing buildings as they grew on site—to busy managers at the main office.

His style drew upon numerous international influences including, among others, Modernism andSurrealism. Although not strictly Surrealist, many of Álvarez Bravo’s works manifest a similarly fantastical mood. One of the artist’s most arresting qualities is his ability to imbue scenes of everyday life with an otherworldly, metaphysical power. The photographs in the exhibition, from UMMA’s collections, show the artist using motifs drawn from Mexican religious and indigenous works as well as plant forms, in a Modernist approach to image making. UMMA docents will discuss these motifs and the artist’s use of light as a metaphor and revealer of life, animating even the emptiest and most silent of Álvarez Bravo’s scenes.",Map Museum of Art,['2016-06-26 14:00'],"['Art', 'Culture', 'Discussion', 'Education', 'Exhibition', 'Free', 'Latin america', 'Multicultural', 'Spanish studies', 'Umma', 'Visual arts']"

31216,Ernestine Ruben at Willow Run,"In 2013, artist Ernestine Ruben (BSDEs ’53) photographed the once-famed industrial complex Willow Run in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Designed by her grandfather, Detroit architect Albert Kahn, for the Ford Motor Company, Willow Run was an exemplar of American defense manufacturing because of its efficient mass-production of B-24 Liberators during World War II. For this exhibition, Ruben overlaid interior views of the now-dormant factory with imagined glimpses into her body’s interior landscape. The resulting compositions seem to breathe energy and light into the stagnant and cavernous spaces of Willow Run and suggest a longing for a productive existence undeterred by mortality for both Willow Run and the artist. Her grandfather’s role in the history of the site underscores Ruben’s personal connection. The exhibition presents Ruben’s photographs of Willow Run in UMMA’s Photography Gallery and an original film—co-created by Ruben and video artist Seth Bernstein and featuring an original score by award-winning composer Stephen Hartke—in the Museum’s Forum. Lead support for Ernestine Ruben at Willow Run: Mobilizing Memory is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost and the Herbert W. and Susan L. Johe Endowment.

This event aims to bring awareness to the issue of plastic pollution in our Great Lakes and to inform and empower citizens to protect their environment and themselves--while simultaneously promoting the involvement of girls and women in STEM fields. In addition to a ship-board sampling event, we will be hosting a land-based outreach and public awareness event in front of the Belle Isle Aquarium throughout the day and a plastic-free BBQ into the evening on August 20. Our mission is to offer an opportunity for the people of Detroit living on and near the lakes and rivers to connect to their local water resource. Our vision is to engage the public with demonstrations of plastics found in the environment, their impact, and what we can do about it! Potential booths/tables and activities include (but are not limited to) information about recycling, crafts with found plastics, a live-streaming video link to the boat while sampling, and a beach clean-up event.

31726,"Mohler Prize Public Lecture: ""Hot Gas in Clusters of Galaxies, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and Cosmology""","Have you ever wondered how we learn about our expanding Universe when it was young? Hear about this from one of the greatest astrophysicists of our time, Rashid Sunyaev, who will be giving the Mohler Prize lecture on Friday, October 7 at 7pm. Professor Sunyaev will speak about the Cosmic Microwave Background and the event that led to its creation long before any stars or planets had formed. Through the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we see tiny variations in the density of the universe that collapses under gravity to form the familiar galaxies and solar systems of today. The CMB also reveals the amounts of dark energy, dark matter, normal matter that comprise our Universe and dictate its evolution and future. Rashid Sunyaev is one of the most distinguished theoretical astrophysicist, with groundbreaking work in high energy astrophysics and physical cosmology. He has made many contribution in the study of the cosmic microwave background radiation, including predictions of variations in the background due to oscillations and to the distortion of the background light through the hot gas in clusters of galaxies (the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect). Predicted well ahead of their discoveries, these have become central fields in modern astrophysics. Another major contribution is his work with Shakura on the accretion disk of gas around black holes and neutron stars, which is the cornerstone for understanding the environment and feeding of these exotic objects. In addition to his theoretical work, Professor Sunyaev has been deeply involved in a number of Soviet space missions: RELIKT, which measured variations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (1980s); he led the team that operated an X-ray observatory on the Mir space station; he was a principal in the GRANAT orbiting X-ray telescope; and he is leading a team to launch the Spectrum-X-Gamma International Astrophysical Project in 2017. Professor Sunyaev was won 14 major prizes or distinguished awards, including the Heineman Prize (2003), the Crafoord Prize (2008), and the Kyoto Prize (2011); the earliest being the Bruno Rossi Prize of High Energy Astrophysical Division of the American Astronomical Society in 1988. In addition to being a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, he is a member of five other distinguished (exclusive) societies. Originally from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, he was educated at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (PhD in 1968), where he became a professor (1975) and held a position at the Moscow Institute of Applied Mathematics, along with being the head of the Laboratory for Theoretical Astrophysics of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1973-1982). More recently, he holds several positions, including Professor at the Institute of Physics and Technology in Moscow, head of the High-Energy Astrophysics Dept. of the Institute for Space Research in Moscow (since 2002; Chief Scientist since 1992), and Director and Scientific Member at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany (since 1996). The Orren C. Mohler Prize was established by the Department of Astronomy in 1986 and is awarded for excellence in research in astronomy and astrophysics.","Map Rackham Graduate School (Horace H.) - Amphitheater, 4th floor",['2016-10-07 19:00'],"['Astronomy', 'Free', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Rackham', 'Research', 'Science']"

For example, through speculative experiments and conceptual drawings Henry discovers in static architectural details an unsettling range of figurative expression, such as the way the profiles of roof eaves resemble human heads.

Moving between these spaces allows me to use one system to observe and understand another.” Graczyk received a Batchelor of Arts in Dance, and a Bachelor of Science in Molecular Biology from the University of Washington Sponsored by the Department of Dance, Center for Research, Learning and Teaching and Course Connections",Map Dance Building - Studio B,"['2016-11-15 12:10', '2016-11-17 12:10']","['Dance', 'Free']"

This talk proposes a way of thinking about musical creativity that embraces both individual and collaborative practice. It is based on the idea of creative emergence, which arises out of the social interactions of collective performance. Cook develops existing approaches to jazz improvisation into a general model of real-time musical collaboration with an approach to composition that focuses on composers' interactions with physical or conceptual objects in the realm of “extended imagination.” Ostensibly solo creativity is based on the structures of social interaction, now translated into the domain of physical and symbolic objects.",Map Earl V.

Later, they explore how each student’s personal rituals can expand to become fragments of choreography.

This talk will begin by briefly considering the “outmodedness” of scientific theories—sometimes paradoxical—and then contrast that with the situation of music theory. Keeping some salutary cautions in mind, I will recount some past uses of older music theories, good and bad, in order to consider which uses are foundationally legitimate. With this as preface I will then turn to a perspective that permeated theoretical language of the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, that known as energetics. In current thinking, energetics is downplayed as vague and ungrounded, but I will argue that concepts we associate with Kurth are indispensable to Schenkerian analysis and even to Riemann’s metric analysis. This will be extensively demonstrated in a close reading of that most energetic work, the first movement of Brahms’s Third Symphony.",Map Earl V.

32353,Department Colloquium | Quantum Phase Transitions: A New Approach From Adiabatic Continuity and Wavefunction Overlap,"In quantum many-body systems, quantum phase transitions are among the most fascinating phenomena. In general, quantum phase transitions can be classified into two categories: (1) conventional and (2) topological. Conventional quantum phase transitions are the quantum generalization of thermal phase transitions. Similar to their classical counterparts, they are characterized by spontaneous symmetry breaking. A topological phase transition doesn’t have any symmetry breaking. Instead, it is the singular point where the quantum wavefunction changes its topology. In comparison to conventional phase transitions, our knowledge on topological phase transitions are much more limited. In fact, we don’t even have a general recipe yet to determine whether two quantum states have the same topology or not, and a complete and constraint-free classification of topological states is still absent. As a step toward this ultimate goal, we prove a general theorem: for two arbitrary quantum states, as long as the inner product between the two wavefunctions is nonzero, there exists an adiabatic path connecting the two quantum states. This theorem can be utilized to study all topological phase transitions in non-interacting or weakly-correlated systems, as well as certain strongly-correlated systems. For topological phase transitions, our theorem implies that two quantum states with finite wavefunction inner product must belong to the same quantum phase and thus have exactly the same topological structure. We will further discussion how this theorem can help us understand the classification of topological states, as well as its implications in experiments.",Map West Hall - 340,['2016-09-14 16:00'],"['Free', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk']"

In particular, the ability to fabricate heterostructures between different 2D materials allows for designer condensed matter systems. In this talk, I will discuss our latest experimental progress on three different types of van der Waals heterostructures. I will first talk about interlayer excitons in semiconductor heterobilayers, which are analogous to spatially indirect excitons in double quantum wells, but with additional valley pseudospin properties. I will then discuss interlayer electron-phonon interactions in heterostructures formed by monolayer WSe¬2 and atomically thin boron nitride, in which a Raman silent phonon in boron nitride is activated by resonantly coupling to the electronic states in WSe2. Finally, I will conclude with a discussion of heterostructures formed by a monolayer semiconductor and a layered ferromagnetic semiconductor, a new system for controlling spin and pseudospin in 2D semiconductors by magnetic proximity effect.

Two accelerating beam trajectories were generated within the glass and imaged onto a CCD; close agreement is shown with theory. The simplicity and compactness of the proposed planar-optics approach to generating accelerating beams opens new opportunities in the realization of accelerating beams and related devices for advanced manipulation of light. 2) Coherent control of quantum dots has been intensively investigated for fundamental interest in physics as well as potential applications. While there are a lot of advantages for using an ensemble of quantum dots, most of studies have been conducted by using single quantum dots due to the technical difficulties. In this talk, I will discuss the experimental demonstration which clearly reveals coherent evolution in the exciton/biexciton system in an InAs self-assmebled quatum dot ensemble [1]. I will first talk about the experimental technique, the pre-pulse two-dimensional spectroscopy, used to observe the coherent evolution in the ensemble system. I will then talk about the experimental results revealing coherent manipulation of exciton and biexciton population by the pre-pulse. Lastly, I will discuss the detuning and trions’ effects, which two dimensional coherent spectroscopy can successfully elucidate.

32360,CM-AMO Seminar | Radiative Heat Transfer at the Nanoscale,"Radiative heat transfer between objects separated by nanometer-sized gaps is of considerable interest due to its promise for both non-contact modulation of heat transfer and for thermophotovoltaic energy conversion. Although radiative heat transfer at macroscopic distances is well understood, radiative heat transfer at the nanoscale remains largely unexplored. In this talk, I will describe ongoing efforts in our group to experimentally elucidate nanoscale heat radiation. Specifically, I will present our recent experimental work where we have addressed the following questions: 1) Can existing theories accurately describe radiative heat transfer in single nanometer sized gaps1? 2) What is the role of film thickness on nanoscale radiation2? and 3) Can radiative thermal conductances that are orders of magnitude larger than those between blackbodies be achieved3? In order to address these questions we have developed a variety of instrumentation including novel nanopositioning platforms and microdevices, which will also be described. Finally, I will briefly outline how these advances can be leveraged for future investigations of both nanoscale radiative heat transport and thermophotovoltaic energy conversion. References: [1] K.

32362,HEP-Astro Seminar | Leadership Cyberinfrastructure for Science and the Humanities,"(Note different date and location) In the past two decades high energy physics transformed its computing model from one relying on a single high performance computing center at the host laboratory to one incorporating resources distributed across institutional boundaries and geographic regions. Given the complexity of detectors and scale of data, the international collaborations of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN demanded it. By removing barriers to resource sharing, the resulting data and computation platform democratized the physics process across collaborations. Accelerated modes of scientific discovery by thousands of physicists were forged using hundreds of data centers linked by very high bandwidth networks. Meanwhile the explosion of commercial, social and enterprise data has driven innovation in resource abstraction and the creation of new service platforms, offering fresh opportunities to accelerate science and intellectual inquiry at all scales and across all domains. In this talk I’ll discuss the strategic significance that cyberinfrastructure technology plays in this regard and describe models for creating ubiquitous “substrates” that remove obstacles to connecting campuses, facilities, instruments and researchers.

He has been a member of the ATLAS experiment using the Large Hadron Collider at the CERN Laboratory, Geneva, Switzerland since 1998. His experimental work led him to specialize in developing and improving distributed computing technologies necessary for discoveries at the frontier of particle physics. He was instrumental in developing early research computing grids in the U.S.: the International Virtual Data Grid Laboratory (iVDGL), and the first deployment of the Open Science Grid (OSG) (NSF, Department of Energy). He have also generated systems for metrics collection for distributed systems (Grid Telemetry, PI, NSF-ITR). Currently, he directs the ATLAS Midwest Tier2 Center, which is comprised of integrated computing facilities from the University of Chicago, Indiana University, and the University of Illinois.",Map West Hall - 340,['2016-09-22 16:00'],"['Free', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk']"
32364,HEP-Astro Seminar | SPT3G: Constraining Fundamental Physics with a New Receiver for the South Pole Telescope,"Precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been among the most powerful probes of cosmological physics, providing information about the structure and matter content of the universe. Even more precise measurements of the CMB and its polarization have the potential to constrain additional physics: testing models of inflation that operate at energy scales of ~1e16 GeV, constraining the sum of the neutrino masses, and probing dark energy. The 3rd-generation of receiver for the South Pole Telescope (SPT), SPT3G, will provide a major advance in CMB sensitivity using an array of 16,000 bolometers operating at 90, 150, and 220 GHz—10 times more detectors than the existing receiver of the SPT. In addition to the scientific motivation for this new instrument, I will describe technical developments in pixel architecture, readout electronics, and optics which enable the large increase in detector count in SPT3G, as well as the status of final ongoing integration occurring at Fermilab before shipping to the South Pole in November. Finally, I will highlight some recent results from the existing receiver on the SPT, SPTpol, to illustrate the prospects for SPT3G.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-09-12 16:00'],"['Astronomy', 'Free', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk']"

32376,Dream as “Being”: Du Liniang and Her Field of “Being”,"This discussion focuses on a tragic heroine Du Liniang in the novel The Peony Pavilion(1598) written by Tang Xuanzu (1550-1616). For several centuries from the Ming and to the Qing dynasty, The Peony Pavilion moved many readers and audiences for many years, particularly female audiences at the final scene when they learned about the tragic fate of Du Liniang. In this presentation, Professor Zou will delve into Du Liniang’s character, a woman who lived under the extremely strict constraint on her living space and spiritual world, both from ideological pressure and constraints on her body. Professor Zou explained that Du Liniang is not a “being” because she is alienated from the real word until she enters a condition of boundless life (death) and starts to have a song of her own, a song that signifies “being.” *Image: Du Liniang and her “being” in three zones Biography ZOU Yuanjiang is Professor of Philosophy and a supervisor of doctoral degree candidates at Wuhan University.

In recent years much has been learned about unitary CFTs through the conformal bootstrap. However, many relevant systems are described by non-unitary CFTs with logarithmic correlation functions, known as logarithmic CFTs. In this talk I will discuss some examples of these models (e.g. critical percolation) and their observables, and explain how the bootstrap paradigm extends to logarithmic CFTs.",Map Randall Laboratory - 3481,['2016-09-14 12:00'],"['Free', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk']"

Moreover, if the strong sector enjoys chiral and custodial symmetries, it can offer a framework for Composite Higgs models, where the Higgs doublet is a partially-composite light ’pion’.

Given the lack of clear evidence for WIMP signatures at direct, indirect and collider searches, we are motivated to look beyond the standard lore. In a model independent framework complementary to LHC monojet searches, we discuss searches at high luminosity colliders for heavy quarkonium decays to dark matter particles with masses below the weak scale. Also, we investigate unconventional MSSM parameter space by relaxing commonly made simplifying assumptions, such as minimal flavor violation, then reexamining constraints from direct dark matter detection and the associated nuclear physics uncertainties. Finally, moving from a single particle to a multi-component dark matter framework, we consider the impact of many particles decaying in the early universe on the application of constraints from light element abundances and the CMB.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-09-16 15:00'],"['Free', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk']"

Positive Links sessions take place at Michigan Ross, and are free and open to the public. ABOUT THE TALK: Smiling is a simple but powerful behavior with interesting ties to social, physical, and mental wellbeing. In her talk, Pressman will outline some of her recent research on the positive and negative effects of this simple act in both natural and experimental paradigms. Outcomes discussed will range from how smiling alters physical stress trajectories, perceptions, and responses to pain, and even how often individuals go to visit a doctor. We also explore behavioral effects of smiling, and reveal the surprising ways that smiling may alter whether or not individuals behave immorally and how positive expressions may alter risky decision making. Pressman will end with a discussion of the possible mechanisms underlying these effects along with important needs in future research. ABOUT PRESSMAN: Sarah Pressman is an award-winning Associate Professor of Psychology and Social Behavior in the School of Social Ecology at the University of California, Irvine. Her work seeks to understand how positive emotions are beneficial for objective physical health and longevity.

Ryff, PhD, is Director of the Institute on Aging and Hilldale Professor of Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her research centers on the study of psychological well-being, an area in which she has developed multidimensional assessment scales that have been translated to more than 30 different languages and are used in research across diverse scientific fields. More than 500 publications have been generated using her scales of well-being. Investigations by Ryff and colleagues have addressed how psychological well-being varies by age, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnic/minority status, and cultural context as well as by the experiences, challenges, and transitions individuals confront as they age. Whether psychological well-being is protective of good physical health is also a major interest, with ongoing longitudinal investigations linking positive psychosocial factors to a wide array of biomarkers (neuroendocrine, immune, cardiovascular) as well as to neural circuitry. A guiding theme in much of this inquiry is human resilience – i.e., how some individuals are able to maintain, or regain, their well-being in the face of significant life challenge and what neurobiology underlies this capacity. Ryff has generated over 200 publications in the areas described above, and she currently directs the MIDUS (Midlife in the U.S.) longitudinal study, which is based on a large national sample of Americans, including twins. Funded by the National Institute on Aging, MIDUS has become a major forum for studying health and aging as an integrated biopsychosocial process. She is also Principal Investigator of MIDJA (Midlife in Japan), a parallel to the MIDUS investigation, for which she received an NIH Merit Award.

32789,Mei Lanfang and Twentieth Century Peking Opera: Transcultural Exchanges,"Mei Lanfang’s visit and performances abroad brought him to Japan in 1919, to the United States in 1930, and to the Soviet Union in 1935. While these performances helped introduce Peking Opera abroad and earned Mei Lanfang universal praise and admiration, they more importantly gave Peking opera an opportunity to highlight, for international audiences, its new cultural identity, to present its art as a modern aesthetic system, and to project its claim to historical authenticity. The Peking opera presented there was not a form preserved from time immemorial, but the outcome of an intense ideological debate among the younger generation of the cultural elite within China as to the validity of traditional Chinese theater with the most radical opinion denouncing Peking opera as the dregs of traditional society, bond up with everything dispicable of the old social order and values, and their opponents boldly claiming the modern relevancy of the form by actively engaging with international performing arts as present in Europe, the US and Japan. Mei Lanfang’s carefully prepared international tours with the radically reformed Peking opera were to decide this debate and the domestic fate of genre altogether through international recognition by audiences that included foreign cultural elite and much of the international avant-garde. In this sense, these tours were the catalyst and the crowning glory of the modernization of the genre. The talk will explore these tours in the context of the shifting self- definition, self-narration and self-historization of Peking opera in its struggle to become China’s “national opera.” *Image:“Mei Lan-fang, China’s Greatest Actor Here for His American Premiere.” Drawing, 1930.

32829,"Friends VS. Enemies: Diplomacy Documentary, Espionage Film, and the Persistence of Class in Cold War China","This talk draws from both documentary films consolidating international friendships and espionage films uncovering hidden enemies to situate cinema at the center of manufacturing class visibility and certainty in a Cold War environment where identities and alliances were in constant flux. Flourishing in the 1950s and early 1960s, espionage films mapped class differences onto bodily practices, sensorial experiences and the urban space, just when political and economic changes had gradually eliminated the foundations of class politics. The persistence of the spectre of class in China’s socialist space, then, must be read in relation to Cold War anxieties of national security and anti-revolutionary infiltration. Indeed, as the Sino-Soviet brotherhood and Sino-Indonesian honeymoon, both celebrated on screen, ended in deepened international hostility and China’s ideological hardening, we see a triple crisis of domestic politics, international relations and visual representation. Diplomacy documentary descended into compulsive repetition and hysterical excess to bolster new screen friendships, for example, that with Albania. Viewing positions from espionage films were applied to real-life political struggles, most telling in using documentary “evidence” to incriminate Liu Shaoqi and Wang Guangmei for their alleged defection. Moving between documentary and fiction, domestic class politics and Cold War geopolitics, this talk attempts to think through the persistence and hardening of the notion of class in a socialist China through the central mediation of cinema.Through textual analysis and historical investigation, this paper argues that cinema’s power in the PRC had deep connections to the country’s spiritual traditions, displacing and re-assembling it to create a new society. *Image: Wang Guangmei in Indonesia",Off Campus Location,['2016-10-07 12:00'],"['Chinese studies', 'Colloquium', 'Film', 'Food', 'Free', 'Lecture', 'Research', 'Talk']"

32852,3500 characters vs. 26 letters: Efficient or Inefficient?,"People unfamiliar with the Chinese language are often amazed by the sheer number of characters used in the written language: Chinese characters 汉字. A Chinese user needs to know about 3,500 characters in order to have a >99% comprehension of the content of an ordinary newspaper article. Compared to the 26 letters in the Roman alphabet, that seems like a lot. But is this an accurate comparison? Are characters in Chinese really equivalent to the letters in an alphabetic language? Does having over 3,000 common characters really make Chinese inefficient, placing an extra burden on learners? In this talk, I will show how characters function in Chinese by discussing what the characters really stand for; the difference between characters and words; how words are formed in Chinese—and how that process differs in Classical vs. Modern Chinese.

32856,Late Life Depression in Elder Chinese,"This lecture will include two major themes. The first is about myths surrounding depression and its treatment. Depression is under-recognized and under-treated in older Chinese adults. I will discuss the prevalence, plausible causes and most often seen symptoms of depression in older Chinese populations. It is challenging to recognize depression in older adults. I will introduce a simple tool that can be used in clinical and community settings for depression screening. Recognition is the first step to treatment. Many treatment options are available for depression. However, misunderstanding especially toward medications, often leads to less than desirable effects. Untreated depression has many dire consequences and a particular concern in older adults is suicide. Older people have the highest rate of suicide among all age groups in most parts of the world. In mainland China, suicide rates among older people continue to rise even when suicide rates for other age groups have decreased in recent years. I will talk about ways to assess suicide risks and handle situations with different levels of risk. The second theme I will address is how to improve recognition and treatment of late-life depression in mainland China where mental health literacy is low and resources for mental health care are very limited. Our team has been working in China to test effectiveness of community-based interventions in urban and rural China. Cultural and structural issues were taken into account when designing these interventions. I will describe these interventions and report findings that are available. Biography Lydia Li is Associate Professor at the School of Social Work, University of Michigan. Her research interest is aging and health. Her current projects include social contexts and health in old age and community-based interventions for late-life depression.

As the newly appointed interim director of CWPS, I explore in this talk a number of potential themes that might be pursued in the coming year as galvanizing agents for this partnership. Improvisation is a primary consideration, with recent years seeing increased attention in the ability to spontaneously create, interact, and adapt to unexpected developments as important not only across the arts but in the sciences and humanities as well. With improvisation playing a prominent role in jazz and much African American music, direct connections open up to a second area—diversity—at a moment when conversation and action on this topic carry particular urgency on our campus, and education and the world at large. I will share reflections from a chapter called “Black Music Matters” in a forthcoming book that juxtaposes the powerful tools African American music offers musicians for global navigation with the continued marginalization of black music in music studies. Linkages are also explored with the burgeoning academic areas of contemplative and consciousness studies, in which education moves from conventional emphasis on exterior learning modalities to engagement with practices that probe the interior dimensions of the learner. Whereas improvisation embodies outer performance, meditation and other contemplative methodologies can be viewed as kinds of inner performance. I close with a look at cutting-edge consciousness research that stretches the boundaries of how the educational world typically views the human being and human potential; the point is not to critique these findings but rather to illustrate further ways an expanded view of performance can inform how we approach radical ideas that challenge existing assumptions. The ability to step outside our comfort zones and entertain new worldviews is perhaps the most important form of performance to be cultivated. The talk will begin with a brief performance with RC faculty members.

My musical Wonder Chamber Project has similar goals—to bring intriguing music found in rare manuscript collections from the past to contemporary audiences. The vehicle for these Wonder Chamber performances is a nearly 400-year-old violin strung with gut strings that, in tandem with equally appropriate historical keyboards, is perfectly suited to animate and color these works that are truly full of wonder.

In Washtenaw County alone, unintentional or undetermined opioid pain reliever overdoses more than doubled from 2014 to 2015 for residents 21 or younger. Behind marijuana, prescription drugs are the second most abused substance among teens today. Many teens mistakenly view prescriptions as a medically safe way to get high. Prescription pain relievers, such as OxyContin and Vicodin, are most commonly abused and teens can get these easily from their homes. Help us keep our teens and children safe.","Pioneer High School -parking lot - 601 W Stadium, Ann Arbor",['2016-10-08 10:00'],"['Alumni', 'Community service', 'Environment', 'Free', 'Health & wellness', 'Social']"

Often displayed in homes of wealthy private collectors, this phenomenon grew out of a humanistic urge to connect with the world at-large, to collect things, catalog them and share them with others. My musical Wonder Chamber Project has similar goals—to bring intriguing music found in rare manuscript collections from the past to contemporary audiences. Music in manuscript, no matter how old, can stimulate the imagination in many ways; the handwritten musical score itself, for example, suggests gestures and emotions that are often lost in translation when put into modern printed notation. The vehicle for these Wonder Chamber performances is a nearly 400-year-old violin strung with gut strings that, in tandem with equally appropriate historical keyboards, is perfectly suited to animate and color these works that are truly full of wonder.",Map Earl V.

This signal probes the matter-velocity correlation function, scaled by the average optical depth (tau) of the galaxy groups and clusters in the sample, and is thus of fundamental importance for cosmology. However, in order to translate pairwise kSZ measurements into cosmological constraints, external constraints on tau are necessary. In this talk I will present the current state of kSZ measurements, including a recent measurement by SPT and DES, insights from simulations, as well as recent progress in modeling the tau profile of galaxy clusters.",Map Randall Laboratory - 3246,['2016-09-28 14:10'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk']"

Due to the size of the dataset, Belle sampled a record breaking 1ab-1 delivered by the B-factory KEK-B, as well as the precision instrumentation and PID capabilities, this dataset represents a milestone for our studies of non-perturbative QCD effects in hadronization. One focus of the Belle program is the precision measurement of Parton Fragmentation Functions, which parametrize non-perturbative hadronization effects in QCD factorization formulas if final state hadrons are detected in semi-inclusive measurements, e.g. in deep inelastic scattering or proton-proton collisions. In particular, Belle results sensitive to transverse polarization dependent fragmentation functions, which can serve as ‘quark polarimeters’, play a crucial role in our understanding of the transverse spin structure of the nucleon. Beyond determining Fragmentation Functions, the study of hadronization allows us access to perturbative and non-perturbative QCD effects, which is complimentary to using the nucleon as our QCD laboratory. This talk will present the latest results from th ongoing program of hadronization studies at Belle. I will also give an outlook towards related physics opportunities at Belle II, which will start data taking next year, sampling about 40 times the luminosity that Belle did.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-10-03 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

This leads us to out-of-time-order correlation functions as a natural measure of quantum chaos. We explain how such correlators are natural probes of the black hole interior in holography. Using tools from quantum information, we use a generalization of these correlators to develop a lower bound on the computational complexity of an ensemble of unitary operators. Finally, we introduce a conjecture that the quantum complexity of a holographic state is dual to the space-time action of the black hole interior.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-10-07 15:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

There is a vast literature on differential equation models of plankton dynamics, and a recent trend in ecological models has considered plasticity in parameters and adaptation. In this talk, we interpret plasticity as prey switching, that is, predator’s adaptive change of diet in response to the abundance of prey. We first analyse a model constructed for one predator feeding on two different types of prey and inspired by plankton observations. This model has a discontinuity between two vector fields. We then discuss two different smooth formulations of the model and compare model predictions with data on freshwater plankton collected from Lake Constance on the German-Swiss-Austrian border. Finally, we discuss a 1 fast-3 slow system for one predator feeding adaptively on two different prey types and inspired by the first model.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-10-10 12:10'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk']"
34335,Quantitative Biology Seminar | Source Reconstruction from Extracellular Potentials: From Single Cells to the Whole Brains,"Extracellular recordings of electric potential remain a popular tool for investigations of brain activity on all scales in animals and humans, from single cells (spikes) to systems studied with depth electrodes (LFP, SEEG), subdural recordings (ECoG), and on the scalp (EEG). They are relatively easy to record but difficult to interpret: since electric field is long range one can observe neural activity several millimeters from its source. As a consequence, every recording reflects activity of many cells, populations and regions, depending on which level we focus. One way to overcome this problem is to reconstruct the distribution of current sources (CSD) underlying the measurement. We recently proposed a kernel-based method of CSD estimation from multiple extracellular recordings from arbitrarily placed probes (i.e. not necessarily on a grid) which we called kernel Current Source Density method (kCSD). In my presentation, I will present the recent advances of this method, latest software implementations, and explain why it works. I will also show two recent developments, skCSD (single cell kCSD) and kESI (kernel Electrophysiological Source Imaging). skCSD assumes that we know which part of the recorded signal comes from a given cell and we have access to the morphology of the cell. This could be achieved by patching a cell, driving it externally while recording the potential on a multielectrode array, injecting a dye, and reconstructing the morphology. In this case we know that the sources must be located on the cell and this information can be successfully used in source estimation. In kESI we consider simultaneous recordings with subdural ECoG (strip and grid electrodes) and with depth electrodes (SEEG). Such recordings are taken on some epileptic patients prepared for surgical removal of epileptogenic zone. When MR scan of the patient head is taken and the positions of the electrodes are known as well as the brain’s shape, the idea of kCSD can be applied to constrain the possible distribution of sources facilitating localization of the foci.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-11-07 12:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk']"

Evidence is emerging that such networks can exhibit rich mechanical phase behavior. A classic example of a mechanical phase transition was identified by Maxwell for macroscopic engineering structures: networks of struts or springs exhibit a continuous, second-order phase transition at the isostatic point, where the number of constraints imposed by connectivity just equals the number of mechanical degrees of freedom. We will present recent theoretical predictions and experimental evidence for mechanical phase transitions in in both synthetic and biopolymer networks. Living systems typically operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium, which affects both their dynamics and mechanical response. As a result of enzymatic activity at the molecular scale, living systems characteristically violate detailed balance, a fundamental principle of equilibrium statistical mechanics. We discuss violations of detailed balance at the meso-scale of whole cells.",Map West Hall - 340,['2016-10-19 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

For this and other heresies, Bruno was burned at the stake in a public square in Rome in 1600. Astronomy and extrasolar planets were a really hot field at the time. Over the past 20 years more than a thousand extrasolar planets have been found, first from ground-based precision Doppler and photometric transit surveys, and more recently by the Kepler space mission. We have concentrated on building precise Doppler systems to survey the nearest stars. Our systems at Lick, Keck, AAT, and Magellan have found hundreds of planets, including 5 of the first six planets, the first saturn-mass planet, the first neptune-mass planet, the first terrestrial mass planet, and the first multiple planet system. In August we announced the discovery of a potentially habitable around the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, based on archival data from the ESO HARPS and UVES spectrometers reanalyzed with improved packages that we have written, and with a dedicated 2 month campaign of high cadence observing on HARPS. This discovery highlights the latest statistical evidence from Kepler and ground-based Doppler surveys that ~30% of stars have potentially habitable planets.",Map West Hall - 340,['2016-10-26 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

34451,HEP-Astro Seminar | Short-Range Fermion Correlations: From neV to MeV,"The atomic nucleus is composed of two different kinds of fermions, protons and neutrons. If the protons and neutrons did not interact, the Pauli exclusion principle would force the majority fermions, usually neutrons, to higher average momentum. However, recent high-energy proton and electron scattering experiments show that short-range interactions between the fermions form correlated, high-momentum, neutron-proton pairs, known as Short-Range Correlations (SRC). Thus, in neutron-rich nuclei the probability of finding a high-momentum (k>kFermi) proton (a minority Fermion) is greater than that of a neutron (a majority Fermion). In this talk I will present the experimental studies of SRC in nuclei and review some of their wide ranging implications to topics in particle and astro physics (including the EMC effect, neutrino scattering and neutron stars structure and properties). Given time, I will also present a new theoretical description of atomic nuclei, using an asymptotic formalism developed to describe ultra-cold atomic gasses.

However, as a wide variety of experiments put such models to the test with no definitive detections, we are challenged to reevaluate this canonical scenario. I will discuss the theoretical motivations and experimental prospects for moving beyond the WIMP paradigm. The focus will be on direct detection experiments, which aim to discover dark matter via its scattering off targets located deep underground. I will present a new proposal to use two-dimensional materials, such as graphene, as targets for dark matter that is lighter than a WIMP.

However, such constraints are biased if mass is not the only thing which matters - a possibility which often goes by the name of Assembly Bias, because the way in which a halo’s mass was assembled is known to correlate with its environment. I will discuss how the scale dependence of bias - which is generic - can be used to make progress even when assembly bias matters.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-11-14 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
34574,HEP-Astro Seminar | Recent Experimental Results on QCD Factorization Breaking of Nonperturbative Functions,"In the last two decades the study of nucleon structure has shifted from a one-dimensional picture to exploring the dynamic three-dimensional structure of partons within the nucleon. In the transverse-momentum-dependent framework, nonperturbative parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs) explicitly carry dependence on partonic transverse momentum rather than only the collinear momentum of the parton with respect to the hadron or produced hadron with respect to the fragmenting parton. The recent interest in the transverse structure of the nucleon has largely been motivated by the novel phenomenological consequences that have been predicted for transverse-momentum-dependent nonperturbative functions. Contrary to the collinear framework, certain transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs are predicted to be process dependent. Additionally, factorization breaking has been predicted in hadronic collisions where a final-state hadron is measured and the observable is sensitive to nonperturbative transverse momentum. This prediction has the interesting quantum mechanical consequence that partons are correlated with each other across the bound state hadrons, rather than being identified with individual PDFs and FFs. Recent results from the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider will be shown which investigate effects that are predicted to be sensitive to the nonperturbative factorization breaking.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-11-21 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
34577,HEP-Astro Seminar | The Continuing Story of Two-Photon Exchange: Results from the OLYMPUS Experiment,"Over the past two decades, a discrepancy has emerged between two different techniques for measuring the proton’s electromagnetic form factors. Unpolarized electron-proton cross section measurements paint a picture of the proton’s internal structure that is incompatible with measurements from polarization transfer experiments. The leading hypothesis is that the discrepancy is caused by a typically neglected radiative correction, hard two-photon exchange (TPE), which would affect the two measurement techniques in different ways. There is no model independent way to calculate hard TPE, but it can be measured experimentally by looking for an asymmetry between the positron-proton and electron-proton elastic cross sections. Three recent experiments have attempted to quantify this asymmetry, and, just last month, the third of these, called OLYMPUS, released its results (arXiv:1611.04685). The OLYMPUS experiment collected data in 2012 at DESY, alternating between 2 GeV electron and positron beams, directed through a hydrogen gas target. The scattered lepton and recoiling proton were detected in coincidence with a large acceptance toroidal spectrometer. The relative luminosity between the two beam species was monitored with three independent systems, and the results comprise 3 inverse fb of integrated luminosity, exceeding by a factor of three the other two TPE experiments combined. In this talk, the case for the TPE hypothesis will be presented, the OLYMPUS experiment will be described, and the results of all three experiments will be compared.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-12-05 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

These measurements directly test one class of models of quantum geometry, which predict an observable decoherence at this scale as the consequence of a lower-dimensional limit on the number of independent geometrical position states. The two interferometer readout signals, each sensitive to 10-14 m displacements in differential position over 40 m, are sampled at 50 MHz and cross-correlated. Quantum-geometrical effects appear as correlations of the position displacements on time scales shorter than 130 ns, the 40-meter light crossing time, or at frequencies below 7.5 MHz. The Holometer in current and future configurations will provide precision tests of a wide class of models of quantum geometry at the Planck scale, beyond those already constrained by currently operating gravitational wave observatories.

34598,CM-AMO Seminar | Visualizing Defects and Nanoscale Inhomogeneity in Topological Insulators,"Topological insulator (TI) is a new quantum state of matter where the insulating bulk is enclosed by Dirac surface states protected by the topology of the bulk band structure[1-3]. This quantum state may host various exotic phenomena such as quantum anomalous Hall effect, Majoranan fermions, and giant spin-hall effect, often realized by chemical doping of TIs. In most TI’s, however, significant bulk conduction due to native atomic defects overwhelms that of surface states, which hampers potential applications of topological surface states. Despite many years’ studies, the nature of native defects in many TIs is still illusive. In this talk, I will present our recent studies of native defects in Bi2Se3 by combining high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and first principle calculation [4]. We identified the major native defects, in particular the Se vacancies and Se interstitial defects that are responsible for the bulk conduction and nanoscale potential fluctuations in single crystals of archetypal topological insulator Bi2Se3. Identification and control of defects in topological insulators are crucial steps toward experimental explorations of topological quantum phenomena.

The photon problem can be mapped exactly onto that of a many-body system of fermions, which is known to exhibit an orthogonality catastrophe when a finite-range local potential is introduced. We predict that the motion of polarizable objects inside a cavity, no matter how slow, as well as their addition and removal from the cavity, will generate a macroscopic, diverging number of low-energy photons. The significance of these results in regard to the quantum measurement problem and the dynamical Casimir effect are also discussed.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-11-08 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

I will discuss recent progress on understanding one such biological clock, in the photosynthetic bacterium S. elongatus. This system has the remarkable feature that the core biochemical oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro with only three purified proteins. Thus, unlike almost all other circadian clocks studied to date, it requires neither transcription nor translation but functions entirely post-translationally. After reviewing what we know about how the in vitro oscillator functions, as well as a few outstanding puzzles, I will turn my attention to the implications of this understanding for clock function in the living cell. In particular, I will argue that the core post-translational oscillator is necessary to make the clock robust to several perturbations present in any growing, dividing cell, but that other specific adaptations are also required. These include negative feedback on the transcription of clock components and the presence of several identical copies of the bacterial chromosome in the same cell. I will conclude by suggesting that, far from being an isolated case, the workings of the circadian clock built entirely on protein modifications actually point the way towards a new understanding of a number of other oscillatory biological systems, which can all be thought of as examples of a new class of ""molecular synchronization oscillators.""",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-11-15 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

The conversion of infrared laser light to the extreme ultraviolet in atomic-gases is a well known example that forms the basis of strong-field atomic physics and attosecond pulse generation. The process can largely be understood in terms of a three-step model that includes periodic field-ionization, acceleration and coherent recombination of electrons from isolated atoms. We have recently discovered that non-perturbative high harmonic generation (HHG) also occurs in crystalline solids[1]. The high-density of solids could lead to compact and efficient sources of coherent short wavelength radiation. The generation mechanism in solids a topic of intense debate and is fundamentally different from atomic-gases in that the it necessarily involves interactions with multiple atoms. In this talk, I will present our recent efforts to understand solid-state HHG, how it differs from gas phase harmonics and its dependence on electronic structure[2-4]. [1] S. Ghimire, A. D.

34604,CM-AMO Seminar | Temperature-like Variables in Granular Materials,"Statistical mechanics has provided a powerful tool for understanding the thermodynamics of materials. Because granular materials exhibit reproducible statistical distributions which depend in simple ways on macroscopic parameters such as volume and pressure, it is tempting to create a statistical mechanics of athermal materials. I will describe a suite of experiments on two-dimensional granular materials which investigate to what extent these ideas are meaningful. For example, under agitated conditions, we measure both bulk and particle-scale dynamics, and find a number of thermal-like behaviors including diffusive dynamics, a granular Boyle’s Law with a van der Waals-like equation of state, and energy equipartition for rotational and translational degrees of freedom. However, the scarcity of free volume within a granular material provides a crucial control on the dynamics, and each of the above thermal-like behaviors is accompanied by interesting caveats. In an apparatus designed to generate a large number of static configurations, we test whether or not various temperature-like variables are able to equilibrate between a subsystem and a bath. We find that while a volume-based temperature known as “compactivity” fails to equilibrate, a stress-based temperature succeeds in satisfying the zeroth law. However, we also identify history-dependent effects which point to the importance of frictional forces in controlling the mechanics of granular materials.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-12-06 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

Thus, three parameters are evaluated (brightness, statical state distribution and indistinguishability) and this generally requires two or more measurements.

We have now determined these basic parameters at the few percent level or better. While simple, our universe is very strange. Atoms make up only 5% of the universe, most of the universe is made of mysterious dark matter and dark energy.

I will first review these variables and then show how they may be understood on a mathematical level as a generalization of geometric quantization. Playing a central role here is the Heisenberg group and its commutative subgroups. Our usual notion of classical space can be identified with a particular choice of commutative subgroup corresponding to a classical Lagrangian subspace of phase space, that is a choice of classical polarization. There are however purely quantum polarizations that correspond to a choice of modular variables. Such quantizations generically involve a dimensional scale in addition to \hbar. In simple quantum systems, the scale is set contextually, for example by a slit spacing. A new notion of quantum space(time) emerges if we suppose instead that the scale is fundamental. I will provide substantial evidence that, contrary to the textbook accounts, this mechanism is present in ordinary string theory. Thus string theory describes an inherently quantum gravitational theory, for which the usual string constructions correspond to certain semi-classical limits with a local space-time interpretation, with string dualities manifest.",Map West Hall - 335,['2016-11-04 15:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

The conference will bring together a wide range of scholars, regulators, policymakers, and practitioners to explore how big data can be used to enhance financial stability and address other challenges in financial markets. The Big Data in finance conference, which is held in collaboration with the Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS), the Michigan Ross School of Business, the Michigan College of Engineering and Michigan Law School will explore ways to make financial data more accessible and more secure, as well as more useful to regulators, market participants, and the public. As new data sets are created, opportunities emerge. Vast quantities of financial data may help identify emerging risks, enable market participants and regulators to see and better understand financial networks and interconnections, enhance financial stability, bolster consumer protection, and increase access to the underserved. Financial data can also increase transparency in the financial system for market participants, regulators and the public. However, these vast data sets can raise significant questions about protecting security and privacy; ensuring data quality; protecting against discrimination or privacy intrusions; managing and analyzing enormous data sets; synthesizing and presenting data in usable form; and sharing data among regulators, researchers, and the public. Moreover, any conflicts among regulators and financial firms over such data could create opportunities for regulatory arbitrage and gaps in understanding risk in the financial system. How should all of that data be aggregated, protected, analyzed, and shared? We have recruited experts domestically and internationally who have considered these questions and published research on these topics, or who have dealt with these issues in their professional roles and can ground the policy initiatives with real-world experience. Please register at http://financelawpolicy.umich.edu/big-data-conference/. *Please note: registration to the Big Data conference is free and open to the public, but space is limited.

The USO and University Choirs join together to perform two great, dramatic and inspiring pieces for large orchestra and large choir. The creative DNA of composer-conductors Bernstein and Mahler was seemingly related. Both were impassioned, extroverted, and nearly frenzied, conductors of the New York Philharmonic. They were achingly introspective, and had an unsettled relationship with religion. In these two pieces of music with voices, they offer us music that rises from the apocalyptic, cynical worlds they at first depict, to sublime visions of unity, transformation, and heavenly bliss.

35157,Equality for Women in the Construction Industry: Using Art to Create Interest in a Stalled Issue,"Susan Eisenberg brings art and activism together to achieve social justice goals. As a poet, mixed media artist and former electrician, she created the ""On Equal Terms"" exhibit, which explores women's experiences in the construction industry. Despite regulations in 1978 that should have opened up roughly 25% of skilled trades jobs to women, women have held only 2.5% of construction jobs since 1981. Come see and discuss how art can be used to renew public and political interest in a topic of economic importance to women and the nation. Cosponsored by The Institute for Research on Women & Gender, the Women in Science & Engineering Program, the Women's Studies department in LS&A, and CEW.

CEW’s Visiting Social Activist Susan Eisenberg will share selected poems and photographs from her new book Perpetual Care. Eisenberg helps us think differently about the embodied relations of health and affliction, particularly in contrast to the social construction of women's health and well-being. Her work may hold special resonance for women of color, who are more likely to live with chronic diseases such as lupus, which affects Eisenberg. From the Back Cover: Incisive, lively, witty, Perpetual Care brilliantly defies its subject matter. Using an impressive range of forms, styles, and metaphors, Susan Eisenberg draws us deeply into the emotional complexities of a “flock of illnesses.” Whatever your background—as patient and/or provider—you will find this book difficult to put down. The poet’s striking photographs add resonance to both the title and these surprisingly hopeful poems. - Martha Collins, poet, Blue Front Register here: http://www.cew.umich.edu/events/poetry-reading-susan-eisenberg/20161017",Map Lane Hall - Seminar Room 2239,['2016-10-26 16:00'],"['Activism', 'Art', 'Books', 'Disability', 'Free', 'Health & wellness', 'Inclusion', 'Medicine', 'Multicultural', 'Public health', ""Women's studies"", 'Writing']"

35981,Special CM-AMO Seminar | Electronic and Surface Structure of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides and Van der Waals Interfaces,"**Please note this seminar time is 3:00 pm and it is taking place in 340 West Hall.** Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have attracted much interest for their potential applications in opto-electronic, spintronics and valleytronics devices. Direct determination of the electronic- and surface structure of TMDCs is crucial to the full understanding of their distinctive properties. In particular, like other atomically thin materials, the interactions with substrate impact the surface structure and morphology of TMDCs, and as a result, their structural and physical properties can be affected. Here, in this talk, I will discuss the electronic structure and surface structure of MoS2 investigated using synchrotron-based spectroscopic photoemission and low energy electron microscopy. Thickness-dependent electronic structure of MoS2 measured by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy directly demonstrates the indirect-to-direct bandgap transition when MoS2 thickness is decreased from multilayer to monolayer. Also, the thickness-dependent surface roughness is characterized using selected-area low energy electron diffraction (μ-LEED) and the surface structural relaxation is investigated using LEED I-V measurements combined with dynamical LEED calculations. Finally, bandgap engineering is demonstrated via tuning of the interlayer interactions in van der Waals interfaces by twisting the relative orientation in bilayer-MoS2 and graphene-MoS2-heterostructure systems.",Map West Hall - 340,['2016-12-02 15:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
35984,Great Lakes Seminar Series,"Please join us for a Great Lakes Seminar Series presentation: Presenter: Silvia Newell, Assistant Professor, Wright State University Title: Nitrogen cycling in eutrophic systems: Case studies in Lakes Erie and Taihu To participate remotely via webinar, please register at: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1637315028733554436. Abstract: Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Lake Taihu and western Lake Erie are driven largely by agricultural nitrogen (N) and phosphorus. Cyanobacterial community dominance and HAB development may depend on ammonium (NH4+) availability, and increased NH4+ has been linked to increased toxin production. Microcystis, the dominant toxic cyanobacterial genus in both lakes, cannot fix atmospheric N2; consequently, it must compete for NH4+ with other primary producers. Understanding the factors that govern N cycling and NH4+ availability is therefore crucial for identifying conditions that stimulate and maintain HABs. Bio: Silvia Newell is an Assistant Professor at Wright State University in Dayton, OH. She has a Ph.D. in Geosciences from Princeton University. Her dissertation focused on biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in low-oxygen marine environments in Chesapeake Bay and the Arabian Sea. For her post-doctoral work, first at Princeton and then at Boston University, she continued her exploration of the nitrogen cycle in the Sargasso Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and Cape Cod. Currently, her work at Wright State focuses on hypereutrophic Lake Erie, Lake Okeechobee, and Lake Taihu in China, as well as local research on the Great Miami River and small lakes.

35997,CM Theory | Gelation and Densification of Cement Hydrates: A Soft Matter in Construction,"5-8 % of the global human CO2 production comes from the production of cement, concrete main binder. The material strength emerges through the development, once in contact with water, of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) gels that literally glue together the final compound. Current industrial research aims at exploring alternative and more environmentally friendly chemical compositions while enhancing rheology and mechanics, to overcome the many technological challenges and guarantee concrete standards. Identifying the fundamental mechanisms that control the gel properties at the early stages of hydration and setting is crucial, although challenging, because of far-from-equilibrium conditions, closely intertwined to the evolution of the chemical environment, that are a hallmark of cement hydration. I will discuss a recently developed statistical physics approach, which allows us to investigate the gel formation under the out-of-equilibrium conditions typical of cement hydration and the role of the nano-scale structure in C-S-H mechanics upon hardening. Our approach, combining MonteCarlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations, unveils for the first time how some distinctive features of the kinetics of cement hydration can be related to the nano-scale effective interactions and to the changes in the morphology of the gels. The novel emerging picture is that the changes of the physico-chemical environment, which dictate the evolution of the effective interactions, specifically favor the gel formation and its continuous densification. Our findings provide new handles to design properties of this complex material and, with an extensive comparison of numerical findings for the hardened paste with experiments ranging from SANS, SEM, adsorption/desorption of N2 and water to nano-indentation, we gain new, fundamental insights into the microscopic origin of the properties measured.

36180,"Special Cosmology Talk | From Natural Inflation to Leptons, Baryons and Cosmological Magnetic Fields","Axions are attractive candidates for theories of large-field inflation that are capable of generating observable primordial gravitational wave backgrounds. These fields enjoy shift-symmetries that protect their role as inflatons from being spoiled by coupling to unknown UV physics. This symmetry also restricts the couplings of these axion fields to other matter fields. At lowest order, the only allowed interactions are derivative couplings to gauge fields and fermions. These derivative couplings lead to the biased production of fermion and gauge-boson helicity states during and after inflation. I will describe some recent work on preheating in axion-inflation models that are derivatively coupled to Abelian gauge-fields and fermion axial-currents. For an axion coupled to U(1) gauge fields we found that preheating is efficient for a wide range of parameters. In certain cases the inflaton is seen to transfer all its energy to the gauge fields within a few oscillations. Identifying the gauge field as the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model can lead to the generation of cosmologically relevant magnetic fields. Coupling the inflaton-axion to Majorana fermions leads to the biased production of fermion helicity-states which can have interesting phenomenological implications for leptogenesis.",Map Randall Laboratory - 3246,['2016-11-23 14:10'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

This is largely due to the complex, multi-scale and nonlinear nature of our brains. We have developed cellular-based network models of the hippocampus based on a whole hippocampus preparation that spontaneously generates theta rhythms. Building on theoretical analyses and performing thousands of simulations, we find that spike frequency adaptation and post-inhibitory rebound constitute a basis for theta generation in large, minimally connected CA1 pyramidal network models. The contribution of post-inhibitory rebound is necessary given cellular adaptation mechanisms but the theta frequency is not directly controlled by it. Our models can serve as a platform on which to develop an understanding of in vivo theta, and of microcircuit dynamics in the hippocampus.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-02-13 12:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

Materials like vanadium dioxide (VO2) and rare-earth nickelates (RNOs) undergo structural and electronic phase transitions that can be driven via thermal, electrical, and optical means. These phase transitions result in dramatic changes in electronic properties, and correspond to large changes in optical properties, especially in the mid-infrared spectral range where the Drude response dominates. Previously we have demonstrated that VO2 integrated into thin film structures enable temperature- and current-tunable absorbers and reflectors and plasmonic antennas, as well as thermal emitters with anomalous temperature dependence. More recently, we looked to expand the palette of tunable optical materials by defect engineering VO2 to alter its properties, and by using less-studied phase-transition materials such as samarium nickelate (SNO). By combining these approaches, thermally driven phase transitions can be found over a range of critical temperatures from below room temperature to above 100 °C. We are currently demonstrating anomalous thermal emitters using SNO, which can mask the temperatures of objects from thermal imagers, and VO2-based metasurfaces with new functionalities using nanoscale defect engineering with ion irradiation.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-01-10 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
36420,"CM-AMO Seminar | Imaging the Motion of Electrons in Semiconductor Structures: The Crazy, the Boring and the New!","Since the early days of studying electron dynamics in solid state systems, experimental capabilities have taken great strides – from generating ultrafast pulses across wide swaths of the electromagnetic spectrum (THz to X-Rays), to squeezing electron bunches into sub-picosecond packets, to resolving electron dynamics through photoemitted electrons. With these technologies, achieving high temporal resolution, spectral resolution and momentum resolution has become a relatively straightforward process. These technologies also have the potential for high spatial resolution, birthing techniques such as 4D Electron Microscopy, time-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy, ultrafast electron microscopy/diffraction and time-resolved photoemission microscopy (TR PEEM). Each with its own advantages, and challenges, the full potential of these capabilities in accessing the spatial dimensions is only just beginning to be explored. Of these, TR PEEM is uniquely capable of resolving electron dynamics simultaneously in space, time, energy and momentum. By combining the temporal resolution afforded by traditional pump-probe techniques with the spatial resolution afforded by low energy electron microscopy, TR-PEEM allows the visualization of electron transport and dynamics in solid state systems at the nano-, femto-scale. In this talk, I will discuss our recent results in imaging electron dynamics in semiconductor structures. In a type-II heterostructure, we image the highly non-equilibrium distribution of electrons in space and energy at the instant of photoexcitation, and thereafter, make a movie of their redistribution in space as they move towards equilibrium. In a p-doped GaAs semiconductor, we image the electron dynamics within a photoexcitation spot – a region inaccessible with optical experiments, wherein we see unexpected and complex non-equilibrium behaviour. Time permitting, I will end with a brief overview of other activities of my group at the newly established Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) in Okinawa, Japan.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-01-17 16:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

NIST-F2 is a second-generation standard developed with a cryogenic microwave cavity and flight region. The 80 K atom interrogation environment reduces the uncertainty due to the blackbody radiation shift by more than a factor of 50. The second part of this talk will introduce our current efforts in developing laser-cooled atomic clocks for the next generation of GPS satellites. The current generation of atomic clocks used in GPS satellites is based on lamp-excited Rb vapor-cell clock techniques that date back 50 years and while the performance is impressive, it is unlikely to be further improved by incremental advances on the already very mature technology. Because the uncertainties of onboard clocks are significant contributors to the overall GPS error budget, there is interest in developing a new generation of robust, small, reliable, and accurate laser-cooled microwave atomic clocks for future generations of the GPS system.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-01-24 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

The purpose of this talk is to help provide some basic background to the new generation of physicists who have grown up during the past 25 years assuming that the Cold War Doomsday Machine was dismantled. It wasn’t. Indeed, it is still on hair trigger in a launch-on-warning posture. Furthermore, in order to get the New START Treaty ratified by the Senate, the Obama Administration committed to modernize all U.S. nuclear “delivery vehicles” and their warheads. And, despite the fact that the U.S. military budget is twice that of China, Russia and Iran combined, President Obama was unable to change U.S. nuclear policy to no first use. Finally, he approved a massive buildup in U.S. ballistic missile defenses that resulted in Russia losing interest in further cuts and China losing interest in capping its slow nuclear buildup.

At its heart, this split no longer concerns carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases, or climate modeling; rather, it is the product of contrasting, deeply entrenched worldviews. This brief examines what causes people to reject or accept the scientific consensus on climate change. Synthesizing evidence from sociology, psychology, and political science, Andrew J. Hoffman lays bare the opposing cultural lenses through which science is interpreted. He then extracts lessons from major cultural shifts in the past to engender a better understanding of the problem and motivate the public to take action.

36507,"Michigan Institute for Data Science, Seminar Series: Bing Liu, PhD","Abstract: Lifelong Machine Learning (or Lifelong Learning) is an advanced machine learning paradigm that learns continuously, accumulates the knowledge learned in the past, and uses it to help future learning. In the process, the learner becomes more and more knowledgeable and effective at learning. This learning ability is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. However, the current dominant machine learning paradigm learns in isolation: given a training dataset, it runs a machine learning algorithm on the dataset to produce a model. It makes no attempt to retain the learned knowledge and use it in future learning. Although this isolated learning paradigm has been very successful, it requires a large number of training examples, and is only suitable for well-defined and narrow tasks. In comparison, we human can learn effectively with a few examples because we have accumulated so much knowledge in the past which enables us to learn with little data or effort. Lifelong learning aims to achieve this capability. As statistical machine learning matures, it is time to break the isolated learning tradition to study lifelong learning. Applications such as intelligent assistants, chatbots, and physical robots that interact with humans and systems in real-life environments are also calling for such lifelong learning capabilities. Without the ability to accumulate the learned knowledge and use it to learn more knowledge incrementally, a system will probably never be truly intelligent. In this talk, I will introduce lifelong learning, discuss related learning paradigms, and present some of our recent work on the topic. Bio: Bing Liu is a professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He received his Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh. His research interests include lifelong machine learning, sentiment analysis, data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing. He has published extensively in top conferences and journals in these areas. Two of his papers have received 10-year Test-of-Time awards from KDD, the premier conference of data mining and data science. He also authored four books: one on lifelong machine learning (coming later this month), one on Web data mining, and two on sentiment analysis. Some of his work has also been widely reported in the press, including a front-page article in the New York Times. On professional services, he serves as the current Chair of ACM SIGKDD. He has served as program chair of many leading data mining conferences, including KDD, ICDM, CIKM, WSDM, SDM, and PAKDD, as associate editor of leading journals such as TKDE, TWEB, and DMKD, and as area chair or senior PC members of numerous natural language processing, AI, Web research, and data mining conferences.

36509,HEP-Astro Seminar | Analyzing MicroBooNE Data with Convolutional Neural Networks,"The MicroBooNE experiment consists of a liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) that sits 470 m from the origin of the Booster Neutrino beam at Fermi National Lab. The goal of the experiment is to advance our knowledge of neutrino-nucleus cross sections and shed light on the MiniBooNE low energy anomaly. The latter is one of several anomalies seen in neutrino oscillation experiments that have been interpreted as hints for non-standard neutrinos. I will discuss the status of MicroBooNE and some of its achievements after one year of data taking. In particular, I will focus on one effort to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to reconstruct and select neutrino events. CNNs, a type of machine learning algorithm, are often the state-of-the-art approach in many computer vision tasks. For example, CNNs have found applications ranging from automated human face recognition to real-time object detection for self-driving cars.

36510,HEP-Astro Seminar | The Search for Time-Reversal Violation Using Pear-Shaped Nuclei,"Experimental tests of fundamental symmetries using nuclei and other particles subject to the strong nuclear force have led to the discovery of parity (P) violation and the discovery of charge-parity (CP) violation. It is believed that additional sources of CP-violation may be needed to explain the apparent scarcity of antimatter in the universe. A particularly sensitive and unambiguous signature of both time-reversal- (T) and CP-violation would be the existence of an electric dipole moment (EDM). The next generation of EDM searches in a variety of complimentary systems will have unprecedented sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model. My talk will focus on certain rare diamagnetic atoms which have octupole-deformed (pear-shaped) nuclei. This uncommon nuclear structure significantly amplifies the observable effect of T, P, & CP-violation originating within the nuclear medium when compared to isotopes with nearly spherical nuclei such as Mercury-199. Certain isotopes of Radium, Protactinium, and Radon are all expected to have enhanced atomic EDMs and will be produced in abundance at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams at Michigan State University.

By applying the linear response theory to both systems we can calculate experimentally measurable quantities, among which are d.c. conductivity for metals and quantized Hall conductivity for insulators. Then starting with Anderson orthogonality catastrophe (AOC), I will talk about the differences and relations between free and interacting Fermionic systems. At last, I will apply mean field theory to Landau Fermi-liquid theory with perfect nesting and show that spin density wave (SDW) state arises.

36591,Musicology Lecture: Prof. Stephanie Jordan (RE-SCHEDULED FROM 2/17),"For a dance historian, analyst, or musicologist writing about dance, what are the implications of knowing about artists’ working processes? In this presentation, Jordan will begin by revisiting interviews she conducted for her 2015 book Mark Morris: Musician-Choreographer. Morris has taken a variety of approaches to music, such that his “choreomusical” styles and strategies have helped dancers and audiences to hear musical scores in new ways. Recent studies of the practices of other contemporary choreographers reveal an intensification in the sharing of “process information.” To illustrate this intensification and its results, Jordan draws from recent choreomusical analyses, as well as interviews with other choreographers. Her research raises a number of questions about how to negotiate a way through the conflicting values and terminologies of interviewers and interviewees, and the mix of rational choices and instinctive decision-making in the creative artistic process. For Jordan, the “genetic” information in the process can be invaluable to a general understanding of dance, while potentially enriching the analysis of individual dances. Asking what sort of relationship might, or might not, exist between the genesis of a work and its final form, she also brings into play musicologist Nicolas Marston’s theory of “dangerous liaisons.”",Map Earl V.

36701,Nam Center Colloquium Series | You are What You Eat: The Practice of Obtaining and Maintaining Nationalist Identity,"Co-sponsored by the Department of Political Science and Political Scientists of Color (PSOC). What does it mean to treat nationalism as if it were a commodity that can be consumed and (re-)produced on the marketplace? This presentation starts with a short yet instructive tale of Monosodium Glutamate or MSG: despite the discovery of the substance by a Japanese chemist in 1908, it was actually the commodification of Chinese nationalism through MSG by patriotic capitalists in China that, to this day, makes the average consumer associate the flavor enhancer with China rather than Japan. This sets the stage for not only introducing the idea of consuming (and producing) identity, but also what it means to conceive of nationalism as a practice or a sustained process rather than a singular emotion or feeling. By introducing some of the commodification activities surrounding the territorial disputes among countries in Northeast Asia—both in terms of consumables and non-consumables—this presentation will showcase the close connection between politics and economics, and also challenge some of the traditional assumptions behind nationalism. Jiun Bang is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Nam Center for Korean Studies at the University of Michigan. Her doctoral project examined the ‘business of nationalism’ and explained how the process of commodification undertaken by various actors within the nation-state influences bilateral inter-state tensions. From 2008 to 2010, she was an associate at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses (KIDA), a government-affiliated research institute in Seoul. During that time, she was the assistant editor of the Korean Journal of Defense Analysis. She received her PhD from the University of Southern California in 2016, an MA in Security Studies from Georgetown University, and a BA in International Relations from Ewha Womans University in Seoul, her hometown.",Map School of Social Work Building - Room 1636,['2017-04-05 16:00'],"['Asia', 'Business', 'Food']"

Among them is a growing number of bilingual children. On the one hand, we marvel at the ease with which young children master new languages. On the other hand, we fear that learning more than one language may delay children’s language acquisition. Questions commonly asked by parents, teachers, and clinicians include: Are bilingual infants delayed in learning to speak? Are bilingual children delayed in learning to read? Do bilinguals confuse their two languages? In this talk, we will address the common myths about bilingual children’s language and literacy acquisition. We will also discuss the implications of bilingualism for children’s cognitive and brain development as well as best strategies for learning languages for children and adults.",Ann Arbor Public Library - Basement,['2017-03-16 19:00'],"['Community service', 'Free', 'Psychology', 'Talk']"
36757,Quantitative Biology Seminar | Precision in Developmental Pattern Formation,"One of the striking examples of robust developmental patterning is the rhythmic segmentation of somites, which are precursors of the vertebral column. Somitogenesis is controlled by the interaction of a gene expression oscillator (the segmentation clock) and posteriorly-moving signaling gradients (the wavefront). The clock provides the temporal information (periodicity), while the signaling gradients provide the spatial information (position of segment boundaries). Pattern formation is regulative; embryos robustly form a fixed number of patterns and the sizes of patterns scale with body or tissue sizes even when total cell number, cell sizes or growth rate are changed experimentally. In order to elucidate the mechanism conferring spatial precision, we have combined surgical and pharmacological experiments with reaction-diffusion based multicellular mathematical modeling. We have shown that a spatial signal differentiator circuit controls segmental determination and pattern scaling. We have found that neighboring cells compare their signal activity to accurately interpret positional information along tissue and commit for segmentation and differentiation. In order to elucidate the mechanism conferring temporal precision, we have counted transcripts of the segmentation clock genes in single cells by performing single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization experiments and analyzed the data with our statistical model. We have shown that clock genes have low RNA amplitudes, expression variability is driven by transcriptional bursts due to gene extrinsic sources.

37034,Great Lakes Seminar Series,"Please join CILER and NOAA GLERL for a Great Lakes Seminar Series presentation: Presenter: Galen McKinley, Professor, University of Wisconsin Title: Spatial variability and potential long-term trends in Great Lakes carbon To participate remotely, please register at: https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8732706556168576513. Abstract: Biogeochemical and carbon cycling in Great Lakes occurs in the context of a highly variable aquatic landscape that is significantly impacted by physical forcing. In order to understand biogeochemical cycling in its mean state and as it changes, we must quantify the role of physical variability in space and time. Here, three carbon cycle examples will be presented. In Lake Superior, analysis of a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model (MITgcm.Superior) shows that physical gradients cause large variation in rates of both production (P) and respiration (R) between nearshore and offshore waters. Accounting for this variability helps to bring the lake-wide carbon budget into balance (Bennington et al. 2012, JGR). In the model, fluxes of organic carbon from nearshore lead to elevated R:P ratios in the slope region, which could support the observed enhanced heterotrophic biomass on the slope (McKinley and Bennington, in prep). Lastly, in all the Great Lakes, I demonstrate that increasing atmospheric CO2 should lead to a reduction of pH by ~0.3 units by 2100, quantitatively the same as projections for “ocean acidification” in the global oceans. In the Great Lakes, the existing carbon cycle observational system is insufficient to track such changes (Phillips et al. 2015). Bio: Professor McKinley studies the mechanisms of the carbon cycle in the global oceans and Great Lakes, with her research lying at the intersection of physical and chemical oceanography. Her primary tools are numerical models and analysis of large datasets. More specifically, her research addresses the physical drivers of ecosystem and carbon cycle variability in the North Atlantic, global oceans and Great Lakes. Professor McKinley teaches oceanography and climate science in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at University of Wisconsin – Madison. She is also very active in service to the national and international scientific and policy-making communities. _____________________________________________________ Questions?

It traces the long history of curds in China, demonstrating that such foods were regarded as delicacies by the elite, and account for their sudden and belated disappearance from the modern Chinese diet. The talk then concludes by exploring the modern legacies of the Chinese fascination with curds.

37140,"CM Theory Seminars | Hunds Interaction, Spin-Orbit Coupling and the Mechanism of Superconductivity in Heavily Hole-Doped Iron Pnictides","Argument will be made for a novel unconventional mechanism for s-wave (A1g) Cooper pairing in heavily hole doped iron pnictides. This mechanism avoids large on-site intra-orbital repulsion, and is favored when the renormalized Hunds interaction exceeds the renormalized onsite inter-orbital Couplomb repulsion. In the absence of spin-orbit interaction, the Cooper pairing has A2g spin triplet character, but with spin-orbit included, the gap transforms as A1g. This is not just a change in bookkeeping. Rather, it results in a qualitative difference in the nature of the pairing instability, and in the temperature dependence of the Knight shift. The resulting gap has most of the features of the structure and gap anisotropy observed in laser angle resolved photoemission, including thepossibility of accidental nodes. It explains why, when such nodes are observed, they appear only on the outer (Eg) Fermi surface, as well as why the overall gap magnitude is smaller there than on the inner (Eg) Fermi surface.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-09 14:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
37141,CM Theory Seminars | Superconductivity Mediated by Quantum Critical Antiferromagnetic Fluctuations: The Rise and Fall of Hot Spots,"The maximum transition temperature Tc observed in the phase diagrams of several unconventional superconductors takes place in the vicinity of a putative antiferromagnetic quantum critical point. This observation motivated the theoretical proposal that superconductivity in these systems may be driven by quantum critical fluctuations, which in turn can also promote non-Fermi liquid behavior. In this talk, we present a combined analytical and sign-problem-free Quantum Monte Carlo investigation of the spin-fermion model – a widely studied low-energy model for the interplay between superconductivity and magnetic fluctuations. By engineering a series of band dispersions that interpolate between near-nested and open Fermi surfaces, and by also varying the strength of the spin-fermion interaction, we find that the hot spots of the Fermi surface provide the dominant contribution to the pairing instability in this model. We show that the analytical expressions for Tc and for the pairing susceptibility, obtained within a large-N Eliashberg approximation to the spin-fermion model, agree well with the Quantum Monte Carlo data, even in the regime of interactions comparable to the electronic bandwidth.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-23 14:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
37142,HET Brown Bag Seminar | A Small Weak Scale from a Small Cosmological Constant,"I will present a framework in which Weinberg's anthropic explanation of the cosmological constant problem also solves the hierarchy problem. The weak scale is selected by chiral dynamics that controls the stabilization of an extra dimension. When the Higgs vacuum expectation value is close to a fermion mass scale, the radius of an extra dimension becomes large, and develops an enhanced number of vacua available to scan the cosmological constant down to its observed value. At low energies, the radion necessarily appears as an unnaturally light scalar, in a range of masses and couplings accessible to fifth-force searches as well as scalar dark matter searches with atomic clocks and gravitational-wave detectors. The fermion sector that controls the size of the extra dimension consists of a pair of electroweak doublets and several singlets. These leptons satisfy approximate mass relations related to the weak scale and can be produced at the LHC and future colliders. If time permits, I will also present purely four-dimensional realizations of the framework. Based on arXiv:1609.06320 in collaboration with Asimina Arvanitaki, Savas Dimopoulos, Victor Gorbenko, and Junwu Huang",Map Randall Laboratory - 3481,['2017-01-18 12:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

There is a surprisingly rich and exotic zoo of multiplets, and sporadic phenomena. As applications, we classify supersymmetry preserving deformations, the absolutely protected multiplets, and the conserved currents or free fields that can appear in superconformal theories.

37145,HET Seminars | The Future is Stochastic (Probably),"Precision calculations in de Sitter space (such as of inflationary predictions for primordial fluctuations) are often plagued by infrared problems and issues of secular time dependence. Similar issues about the breakdown of perturbation theory seem also to arise for information loss in black holes. This talk briefly summarizes how similar problems can arise in other areas of physics, and how they are dealt with when they do. It is argued that Master-Equation techniques used in areas like optics also apply to cosmology (and possibly black holes) and can tell us how to extract reliably late-time predictions. Applied to inflation they lead to Starobinsky's stochastic methods (plus small but important corrections). This is argued to provide an explanation for why stochastic inflation seems to resum IR effects in simple examples, and allows these tools to be generalized to apply more broadly. I mention in passing the relevance of these tools to the problem of Schrodinger's Cosmologist: how primordial fluctuations decohere sometime between their production during inflation and their observation early in the present Big Bang Epoch.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-01-20 15:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

To fulfil these aspirations, we must challenge imbedded assumptions and provide business leaders with actionable strategies and tools for achieving impact at scale. Focusing on the base of the pyramid – which includes the four billion poorest people on this planet – Ted London will draw from his new book to present a roadmap for building sustainable, scalable businesses that generate positive impacts for companies and move us toward a more equitable and inclusive global society. About London: Ted London is Vice President, Scaling Impact Initiative at the William Davidson Institute and a member of the faculty at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. An internationally recognized expert on the intersection of business strategy and poverty alleviation, London focuses his research on developing enterprise strategies for base of the pyramid (BoP) markets, building cross-sector collaborations, and enhancing mutual value creation. His latest book, The Base of the Pyramid Promise: Building Businesses with Impact and Scale, translates over 25 years of research and field-based experience into actionable strategies, frameworks, and tools for developing sustainable, scalable enterprises in BoP markets.

37275,The Gender Leadership Gap: Barriers and Bias in the Academy and Beyond,"Kevin Miller, Senior Researcher at the American Association of University Women (AAUW), gives the February Emergent Research lecture. About the talk: In almost every industry and institution, men occupy leadership positions at a vastly disproportionate rate. For instance, in the private sector workforce, white men in particular are nearly twice as likely to be executives as would be expected by chance. Women now receive the majority of university degrees at almost all levels, including the doctoral level, and women now make up the majority of junior faculty and instructors at many colleges and universities. But as in other sectors, leaders at universities are still disproportionately likely to be men. Will time alone close the gender leadership gap in the academy? What can be done to eliminate the barriers and bias facing women? Kevin Miller of the American Association of University Women will review statistical information and research on the gender leadership gap, with a focus on issues facing women in the academy. Sponsored by the University Library and the ADVANCE program. Emergent Research events are aimed at better understanding the various types of research undertaken across campus, particularly as they relate to library services and support, opportunities for collaboration, data management and preservation, and beyond.",Map Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library - Gallery (Room 100),['2017-02-16 13:00'],"['Free', 'Lecture', 'Library', 'Research', ""Women's studies""]"

37369,HET Seminars | Naturalness in the Dark,"The search for physics beyond the Standard Model at the LHC is largely oriented towards new particles associated with solutions to the electroweak hierarchy problem. While the precise character of these partner states may vary from model to model, they typically possess large QCD production rates favorable for detection at hadron colliders. Null results in searches for partner particles during Run 1 of the LHC have placed the idea of electroweak naturalness under increasing strain. In this talk I'll discuss a broad class of natural theories where the new degrees of freedom relevant for naturalness lie in hidden sectors and are largely unconstrained by LHC data. Rather than rendering electroweak naturalness untestable, they give rise to entirely new signs of naturalness at the LHC, including displaced decays and other exotic signatures. They also furnish a variety of viable dark matter candidates testable at current and future experiments.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-01-27 15:00'],"['Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

37425,Environmental Research Seminar: Health effects of the 2008 northern California wildfires: a spatiotemporal approach,"Abstract: We investigated health effects associated with fine particulate matter during a long-lived, large wildfire complex in northern California in the summer of 2008. We estimated exposure to PM2.5 for each day using an exposure prediction model created through data-adaptive machine learning methods from a large set of spatiotemporal data sets. We then used Poisson generalized estimating equations to calculate the effect of exposure to 24-hour average PM2.5 on cardiovascular and respiratory hospitalizations and ED visits. We further assessed effect modification by sex, age, and area-level socioeconomic status (SES). We observed a linear increase in risk for asthma hospitalizations (RR=1.07, 95% CI=(1.05, 1.10) per 5 µg/m3 increase) and asthma ED visits (RR=1.06, 95% CI=(1.05, 1.07) per 5 µg/m3 increase) with increasing PM2.5 during the wildfires. ED visits for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were associated with PM2.5 during the fires (RR=1.02 (95% CI=(1.01, 1.04) per 5 µg/m3 increase) and this effect was significantly different from that found before the fires but not after. We did not find consistent effects of wildfire smoke on other health outcomes. The effect of PM2.5 during the wildfire period was more pronounced in women compared to men and in adults, ages 20–64, compared to children and adults 65 or older. We also found some effect modification by area-level median income for respiratory ED visits during the wildfires, with the highest effects observed in the ZIP codes with the lowest median income. Using a novel spatiotemporal exposure model, we found some evidence of differential susceptibility to exposure to wildfire smoke. Short bio: Colleen Reid’s research focuses on the interaction of environmental and social exposures on population health with a particular focus on the health impacts of exposures influenced by global climatic changes and society’s responses to those changes. Specifically, she has led research projects on the health impacts of the 2008 northern California wildfires, and the creation and evaluation of a national neighborhood-level map of vulnerability to extreme heat events. Trained in environmental epidemiology and spatial exposure assessment at the University of California, Berkeley, her post-doctoral training was in social epidemiology as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health and Society Scholar at Harvard University.

37481,RC Faculty Talks 2017:  Stephen Ward: On the Meaning and Memory of 1967,"The year 2017 will occasion a range of commemorative activities on campus in recognition of various noteworthy historical anniversaries. The university, of course, will celebrate its bicentennial, while the Residential College will proudly mark its 50th year. Indeed, reaching this milestone provides a wonderful opportunity to reflect on the RC’s evolution and its many accomplishments over this half-century. We can gain valuable perspective on this milestone by recalling something of the intellectual and political moment from which the RC emerged. Pivotal developments of that year that shocked and shaped the world in 1967 continue to have enduring impacts today. This talk will suggest the value in reconsidering selected events of that momentous year—including the Arab-Israeli War, the Detroit Rebellion, and Martin Luther King’s speech, “Beyond Vietnam”—and use this to offer some thoughts on the unfolding of intellectual and political currents since 1967.

37482,HEP-Astro Seminar | Nucleosynthesis and Neutrinos Near Newly Formed Compact Objects,"The origin of the r-process elements remains the biggest unsolved question in our understanding of chemical evolution in the Milky Way. The most likely astrophysical sites for the formation of these nuclei involve dynamical events in the lives of neutron stars: the inner most regions of massive stars during core collapse supernovae and the merger of a neutron star and another compact object. In both of these environments, nuclear physics plays a paramount role in determining both the evolution of the dense object itself, the properties of neutrinos that are emitted, and what nuclei are synthesized in material that is ejected from the system. In this talk, I will discuss neutrino emission and nucleosynthesis in core collapse supernovae and in neutron star mergers, and some of the theoretical uncertainties that exist in these scenarios.. Astrophysical observables that may give us a direct window into the formation of the r-process elements and the properties of dense matter will also be examined.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-13 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
37483,HEP-Astro Seminar | Shining Light on the Hidden Pathways of Galaxy Transformation,"The morphological and color bimodalities displayed by modern-day galaxies suggest that a galaxy must have rapidly transformed from one class to the other. In the modern universe, this transition is one-way, which makes it essential to gain a census of initial conditions capable of catalyzing this metamorphosis. Classical searches that capture transitioning galaxies via signatures of intermediate-aged stars and lack of nebular ionized gas emission exclude the very gas physics that are often fundamental to understanding the galaxy’s transition. I will present the Shocked POststarburst Galaxy Survey (SPOGS), a novel method for finding previously-missed transitioning galaxies using their ionized gas line ratios. I will discuss early results suggesting my SPOGS criterion pinpoints objects at an earlier phase of transformation, when more signs of transition triggers still exist. Our exquisite case study, NGC1266, demonstrates the success of this method. These new observations shed light on the fundamental role gas plays in the ultimate quenching and transformation of a galaxy.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-20 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

Much is currently unknown about this process, including what spatial structure it had, when it started and completed, and even which sources drove it. I will discuss what recent Lyman-alpha forest measurements tell us about the reionization process and about structure formation in the first billion years.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-27 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
37485,HEP-Astro Seminar | Neutrino Mass from Cosmology,"Neutrinos are the only standard model particles of unknown mass. Thus, measuring their mass is one of the leading goals in fundamental physics. Cosmology currently provides the tightest bounds on the sum of the neutrino masses and the possibility that next generation experiments can provide a detection looks promising. Then, further questions would have to be addressed, such as those related to the neutrino hierarchy and the neutrino nature. In this talk, I will discuss the treasure trove of information about massive neutrinos that we can collect from different cosmological probes. In particular, I will show that the combination of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Large Scale Structure (LSS) measurements provides a tight and robust bound on the neutrino mass scale and I will introduce a novel method to assess the sensitivity of cosmological data to the neutrino hierarchy. Finally, I will choose a different angle and show how massive neutrino unknowns can affect the constraints on inflationary models. Important findings in the neutrino sector are just around the corner and cosmology, in combination with laboratory avenues, will unveil neutrino secrets in the coming years.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-04-03 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

Breast tissue is imaged routinely to locate cancer with the hopes of finding the disease in infancy. X-ray mammography, a common tool used to diagnose breast cancer, has problems with the ability to detect lesions in dense breasts. Alternatives, such as MRI, are very expensive. Conventional ultrasound techniques mitigate some of the problems of mammography, but also suffer from their own. To mitigate and improve upon many of these issues of the other imaging modalities, Delphinus Medical Technologies Inc., has developed the SoftVue™ ultrasound imaging system. Ultrasound tomography is capable of producing conventional B-mode ultrasound reflection images as well quantifying acoustic parameters such as sound speed and attenuation. The reconstructed images then can provide radiological information that can find and differentiate benign and malignant breast disease. In order to accomplish the goal of producing a commercial medical device to benefit the patient, diverse teams ranging from research to marketing must work together. In addition to the science of ultrasound tomography, the role of researchers in this environment will be discussed.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-01-20 12:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

37986,Human-Centered Computing: Using Speech to Understand Behavior,"Abstract: Emotion and mood have intrigued researchers for generations. This fascination has permeated the engineering community, motivating the development of affective computational models for classification, particularly in the domain of assistive technology for mental health. Effective treatment and monitoring for individuals with mental health disorders is an enduring societal challenge. Regular monitoring increases access to preventative treatment, but is often cost prohibitive or infeasible given high demands placed on health care providers. Yet, it is critical for individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a chronic psychiatric illness characterized by mood transitions between healthy and pathological states. Transitions into pathological states are associated with profound disruptions in personal, social, vocational functioning, and emotion regulation. I will present our ongoing work investigating new approaches in speech-based mood and emotion modeling. Bio: Emily Mower Provost is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department (CSE) at the University of Michigan. She received her B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tufts University, Boston, MA, in 2004 and her M.S. and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles, in 2007 and 2010, respectively. Her research interests are in human-centered speech and video processing and multimodal interfaces design. The goals of her research are motivated by the complexities of human emotion generation and perception. She seeks to provide a computational account of how humans perceive emotional utterances (“emotion perception”) and combines this with knowledge gleaned from perception estimation studies (“emotion recognition”) to develop systems capable of interpreting naturalistic expressions of emotion utilizing a new quantification measure (“emotion profiles”). She has published many articles in these areas and is a contributor to the winning paper in the classifier category of the 2009 Interspeech Emotion Challenge, a best student paper at ACM Multimedia 2014, and an honorable mention at IEEE ICMI 2016. She also received the Oscar Stern Award for Depression Research (2015). For more information on MIDAS or the Seminar Series, please contact midas-contact@umich.edu.

38166,Conference: Standing with Spain: Anti-Fascist Student Activism and the Spanish Civil War,"From 1936 to 1939, large numbers of U-M students mobilized to support the Spanish Republic as it fought a military uprising backed by Hitler and Mussolini. They joined an international movement that sought to make Spain the “tomb of fascism.” In the Michigan Daily, news of the Spanish war unfolded on the front pages, and debates erupted in the op-ed section. The Student Senate passed a resolution urging the U.S. government to lift the embargo on selling arms to Spain. Students formed an aid committee, held rallies, and raised funds to send an ambulance to Spain. Three students volunteered for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and fought in Spain, one of whom would never return. In this conference students will present their original research on anti-fascist student activism at U-M. All events are free and open to the public.

For more information and to register please visit: myumi.ch/Jy0RM During the past four years, in collaboration with carillonist and contemporary carillon music champion Tiffany Ng, I have created several new algorithmically composed works for carillon, which she has widely performed at a variety of international festivals and concerts. Each work relies on a different experiment with generative pattern, and all have been realized using the Abjad API for Formalized Score Control (Baca, Oberholtzer, Trevino; 1997-present), an extension of the widely used Python programming language that enables composers to create scores via an object-oriented model of common practice western music notation. In this presentation, I demonstrate my code-based compositional process and describe the generative mechanisms underlying my work, which range from historical composition techniques — such as prolation canon and arpeggiation based on harmonic verticalities — to novel conceptual experiments, such as metaphors of rhythmic noise and melodic nesting via search algorithms. I place these abstract materials and developmental strategies in discourse with the instrument’s relatively more concrete physical and timbral restrictions, to frame the tension between abstract pattern and listened or performed physicality as a restorative force in my compositional practice.",Map Earl V.

For more information and to register please visit: myumi.ch/Jy0RM Feld says, “Gregory Bateson’s 1972 essay collection Steps to an Ecology of Mind begins with a series of ‘metalogues,’ thought experiments mapping unruly subjects in science and epistemology in the form of conversations with his daughter, Mary Catherine Bateson. These father-daughter metalogues are exercises in how subjects and objects fuse through the dialectical play of conversational structure. At their best, they exemplify how evolutionary complexities are no less emergent processes than the dialogical attempts to reveal them. Inspired by Bateson’s playful excursions into knowledge production, my foray into the material and affective ‘what-ness’ of bells–their relational ontologies–starts with a series of listening conversations with my daughter, Clochanda, and two of her good friends, Mikhail Bakhtin and Michel Foucault. Together we visit with goats and shepherds, sheep and carnivals, campanile and churches, blacksmiths and carillonneurs, and conclude with a live performance encounter featuring oud virtuoso Rahim AlHaj of Baghdad, Iraq, and the World Peace Bell of Newport, Kentucky.”",Map North Quad - Erlicher Room,['2017-04-01 16:00'],"['Bicentennial', 'Free', 'Music', 'Umich200']"

38270,But Not the Loud Offensive Type,"Karla Goldman, Sol Drachler professor of Social Work and professor of Judaic Studies at U-M, speaks about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at the University of Michigan during the Era of Jewish Admissions Quotas, 1925-1939. Kosher reception to follow. About the talk: Beginning in the 1920s, as Northeastern elite private universities began imposing quotas on the percentage of Jewish students on campus, the University of Michigan became an attractive destination for children of East Coast immigrant families. The University has long pointed to the presence of Jewish students during this period as evidence of its historic commitment to inclusion and diversity. Efforts by American universities to limit the number of Jews on campus in the early and mid-twentieth century was an important factor in shaping American university admissions policies and education. Understanding how and whether the University of Michigan participated in these exclusionary developments is critical to the history of the University. Professor Goldman discusses evidence drawn from University admissions practices and the religious profile of University of Michigan students in the 1920s and 30s to explore the ways in which the University both welcomed and limited the presence of Jewish students in this period. Given the intense focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion in this bicentennial year of the University of Michigan, a better understanding of the University’s historical approach to inclusion and diversity is particularly timely. We suggest you arrive early or stay late to see the related exhibit, Striving to Stimulate Serious Thought: Jewish Scholarly and Cultural Life at Michigan Across Two Centuries on display in the Special Collections space on the 7th floor of the Hatcher Graduate Library South.

We then need to be able to effectively apply that knowledge to our work in the classroom. For the past 5 years, I have been engaged in a collaborative effort leading a course transformation program at a large research intensive university. The transformations were guided by the motivational framework of self-determination theory. I will share the motivational principles underlying successful transformations in higher education as well as the associated research evidence.

His research characterizes the conceptual frameworks and patterns of reasoning used by chemistry students to answer questions and solve problems that require qualitative reasoning (e.g., classification, prediction, inference, comparison). He is exploring how students' ideas and reasoning strategies evolve as they develop more expertise in the discipline (trajectories of expertise).

The University of California, Riverside (UCR) is one of the most diverse research universities in the country. More than half of the 5000 students in our College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences (CNAS) are supported by Pell grants, are members of underrepresented groups, and are first generation college students. To improve student persistence in STEM, CNAS has focused on two experiential interventions for first year students: (1) Learning Communities - designed to engage groups of 24 students with faculty, academic advisors and near-peer mentors, and (2) the Dynamic Genome course - an authentic research experience where UCR research faculty take ownership of a section and bring the excitement of their research labs to the classroom. The Dynamic Genome (DG) course is an alternative to the traditional Intro Bio Lab where learning communities are randomly assigned to one lab experience or the other. Now in its sixth year at UC Riverside, DG is a hands-on bioinformatics/wet lab course that is taught in the state of the art Neil A Campbell Science Learning Laboratory. First articulated in my HHMI Professor Program in 2006, the DG course was initially proposed as an undergraduate laboratory that replicated my research lab where students learned to navigate cutting-edge methodologies applied to transposable elements in eukaryotic genomes. UC Riverside has proven to be fertile ground for the rapid expansion of the DG course model to a projected 24 sections with a total of 600 first year students by 2018. With the tools and knowledge gained from the Learning Community and Dynamic Genome experiences, an increasing number of students are entering faculty laboratories as first or second year students.

38315,In Search of Wang Wei,"""The Art Historical Art of Song China Workshop"" will kick off with Professor Richard Barnhart's lecture at the Michigan Union Pendleton Room. This international workshop is hosted by the Department of the History of Art in cooperation with the University of Michigan Museum of Art and the University of Michigan Confucius Institute. Click on the link here to see the full workshop schedule: http://china-art-song.hart.lsa.umich.edu/ Abstract: Wang Wei (701-761), one of China’s greatest poets, left a legacy of ineffable poetry that is still read and admired around the world. He is also remembered as a great painter despite the fact that not a single painting by him is known to have survived and the reasons for his stature have not been identified. Seeking to recover what remains of Wang’s lost art, and to separate it from the debased replicas of his Wangchuan compositions said to have been copied by Guo Zhongshu (and many others), and the archaic snowy landscape handscrolls supposedly copied by Yan Wengui and Xu Daoning, we find it inextricably imbedded in the very origins and identity of Song landscape painting itself. The painter Wang Wei who emerges from this examination was the peer of Dong Yuan and Fan Kuan, and as important as Li Cheng and Guan Tong in establishing the character of Song landscape painting. About the speaker: Richard M. Barnhart studied art history at Princeton University with Wen Fong and Shujiro Shimada, and at Harvard University with Max Loehr. He spent most of his career teaching at Yale University and writing books and articles on Chinese art history. Since his retirement in 2000 he has lived with his wife Catherine on San Juan Island, off the northwest coast, and continues a lifelong dedication to the study of Song painting.",Map Michigan Union - Pendleton Room (2nd Floor),['2017-04-06 19:00'],"['Art', 'Chinese studies', 'Free', 'History', 'Lecture', 'Talk']"

38351,Department Colloquium | Topological Boundary Modes from Quantum Electronics to Classical Mechanics,"Over the past several years, our understanding of topological electronic phases of matter has advanced dramatically. A paradigm that has emerged is that insulating electronic states with an energy gap fall into distinct topological classes. Interfaces between different topological phases exhibit gapless conducting states that are protected topologically and are impossible to get rid of. In this talk we will discuss the application of this idea to the quantum Hall effect, topological insulators, topological superconductors and the quest for Majorana fermions in condensed matter. We will then show that similar ideas arise in a completely different class of problems. Isostatic lattices are arrays of masses and springs that are at the verge of mechanical instability. They play an important role in our understanding of granular matter, glasses and other ‘soft’ systems. Depending on their geometry, they can exhibit zero-frequency ‘floppy’ modes localized on their boundaries that are insensitive to local perturbations. The mathematical relation between this classical system and quantum electronic systems reveals an unexpected connection between theories of hard and soft matter.

38356,CM-AMO Seminar | Contaminant-State Broadening Mechanisms in a Driven Dissipative Rydberg System,"The strong interactions in Rydberg atoms make them an ideal system for the study of correlated many-body physics, both in the presence and absence of dissipation. Using such highly excited atomic states requires addressing challenges posed by the dense spectrum of Rydberg levels, the detrimental effects of spontaneous emission, and strong interactions. A full understanding of the scope and limitations of many Rydberg-based proposals requires including these effects, which typically cannot be described by a mean-field treatment due to correlations in the quantum coherent and dissipative processes. We study a driven, dissipative system of Rydberg atoms in a 3D optical lattice, and observe substantial deviation from single-particle excitation rates. We attribute these effects to unavoidable blackbody-induced transitions to nearby Rydberg states of opposite parity, which have large, resonant dipole-dipole interactions with the state of interest. Even at low densities of Rydberg atoms, uncontrolled production of atoms in other states significantly modifies the transition energies of the remaining atoms. These off-diagonal exchange interactions result in complex many-body states of the system and have implications for off-resonant Rydberg dressing proposals.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-02-07 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

The semiconducting members of the TMD family including MoS2, MoSe2 and WSe2 have not only demonstrated many of the ""graphene like"" properties desirable for electronic applications such as a relatively high mobility, mechanical flexibility, chemical and thermal stability, and the absence of dangling bonds, but also have a substantial band gap (1 ~ 2 eV depending on the material and its thickness), which is absent in 2D graphene but required for mainstream logic applications. However, a major bottleneck in electronic applications of TMDs is their tendency to form a substantial Schottky barrier with most electrode metals, which severely limits their performance. In this talk, I will discuss our recent work aiming to overcome this fundamental challenge and subsequently explore the intrinsic transport properties of TMDs. Particularly, we have used heavily doped graphene and 2D semiconductors to fabricate low-resistance ohmic contacts for a variety of TMDs.1, 2 1. Chuang, H.-J.; Chamlagain, B.; Koehler, M.; Perera, M.

Among them erbium takes a special place because the Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier has revolutionized the telecommunications by giving access to long distance communication. The transposition of this scheme to quantum cryptography is appealing. The core element of the so-called quantum repeater is an optical memory [1] for which direct operation at 1.5mm is desirable. We use an erbium doped crystal in the C-band of telecom. I’ll essentially focus on the material properties: how they impact the memory performances and how they can be controlled in this prospect. I’ll first introduce the general properties of rare-earth ions inserted in optical crystals. The goal of theses opening remarks is essentially pedagogical. To pay honour to whom honour is due, I’ll give also points of comparison with other atomic systems as atomic vapours (hot or cold), trapped ions or coloured centres in diamond. I’ll briefly review the recent work that we did on an erbium doped yttrium orthosilicate sample (Er3+:Y2SiO5) by applying an original protocol named Revival of Silenced Echo (ROSE) [2]. These later is quite efficient in Er3+:Y2SiO5 [2] as compared to other protocols. I’ll finally show that these performances are limited by the erbium-erbium electron spin interaction [3]. Although we work on the optical transition, the spin properties are absolutely critical for the coherence time governing the memory storage time. As an illustration, I’ll present a recent study of an Er3+:Y2SiO5 crystal in which we added a controlled level of disorder with scandium as co-dopant [4]. This perturbation can surprisingly increase the coherence time at low magnetic field. This counter intuitive result is due to the reduction of Er-Er spin flip-flop rate because the disorder effectively slows down the flip-flop mechanism by making the magnetic interaction non resonant.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-14 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

When a bosonic particle's Compton wavelength is comparable to the horizon size of a black hole, superradiance of these bosons into bound ""Bohr levels"" extracts energy and angular momentum from the black hole. The occupation number of the levels grows exponentially and the black hole spins down. One candidate for such an ultralight boson is the QCD axion with decay constant above the GUT scale. Current black hole spin measurements disfavor a factor of 30 (>100) in axion (vector) mass; future measurements can provide evidence of a new boson.

Speaker Bios: HELEN MOORE Helen Moore has been a life-long advocate and warrior for the children of Detroit, beginning with her days as a State of Michigan Social Worker and continuing with Black Parents for Quality Education and The Keep the Vote No Takeover Coalition. She is also a member of Detroit’s Council of Elders. Ms. Moore educates her community on school district policy, student rights, and other education-related legal issues and parental involvement efforts. She earned a bachelor's degree from Wayne State University and a juris doctorate from the Detroit College of Law. BERNA RAVITZ My passion for education began bubbling within me long before I could articulate it. As a youngster I was decidedly unchallenged by school. Ironically that led me to acquire a Bachelor’s in Psychology, a Master’s in Education, certification in Bilingual Education, and finally, a Doctorate in Curriculum and Instruction. All of this was in pursuit of the magic formula for 'evening the playing field' for all of my students. I began utilizing gifted and talented strategies (constructivist education) and saw amazing results in the progress of our students. My Experience as Michigan Teacher of the Year, National Distinguished Principal as well as an Educational Fulbright exchange allowed me such incredible experiences that are invaluable in my work even today. Upon retirement from my being a principal, I worked for several years as an Educational Coach in Detroit Public Schools; I currently dedicate my time towards fulfilling the mission of Simply Start Kids.

My book, How China Escaped the Poverty Trap, tackles this long-standing, chicken-and-egg (endogenous) problem in development through a dynamic, complex systems approach. I argue that this chicken-and-egg debate is false because it incorrectly assumes that development is a linear process, wherein causality runs in only one direction. In fact, development is a coevolutionary (mutually causal) process that occurs in three reciprocal steps: harness existing weak institutions to build markets > emerging markets stimulate strong institutions > strong institutions preserve markets. I demonstrate this argument through the primary case of reform-era China, with extension to three secondary cases: late medieval Europe, antebellum United States, and contemporary Nigeria. This alternative sequential theory challenges deeply held assumptions that have long guided development theories and practices.",Map West Hall - 411,['2017-02-14 11:30'],"['Complex systems', 'Free', 'Political science', 'Research', 'Seminar', 'Talk', 'Workshop']"
38428,Victors for Art: Michigan's Alumni Collectors–Part I: Figuration,"Commemorating the University of Michigan’s 2017 Bicentennial, Victors for Art: Michigan’s Alumni Collectors celebrates the deep impact of Michigan alumni in the global art world. This two-part exhibition (Part I: Figuration followed by Part II: Abstraction on view July 1– October 29) presents works collected by a diverse group of alumni that represent the breadth of the University and over seventy years of graduating classes. The works themselves are equally diverse, ranging from ancient sculptures to contemporary multimedia works. Part I: Figuration features works by Henri Matisse, Elizabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun, Mark Tansey, and Mickalene Thomas, among others, and allows visitors to explore the variety of artistic responses and purposes encompassed by the term “figuration”. It also offers an unprecedented opportunity to view art that may have never been publicly displayed otherwise—and most certainly, not all together. For visitors, and especially for future Michigan alumni, Victors for Art illuminates the shared passion for art fostered by the Michigan experience. This exhibition was organized by Joseph Rosa, Guest Curator, in collaboration with Laura De Becker, Helmut & Candis Stern Associate Curator of African Art, Jennifer Friess, Assistant Curator of Photography, Lehti Mairike Keelman, Assistant Curator of Western Art, and Natsu Oyobe, Curator of Asian Art.

It is known that cell motility leads to deformation of the tissue. We argue here that the deformations are generically plastic and irreversible. We study an experimental model system of breast cancer cells in collagen-I. We observe large, irreversible deformations, namely dense collagen bundles between cells which do not decay when the cells stop contracting. We give a numerical model that shows how sliding of cross-links in the collagen can give the observed results. The same model reproduces bulk rheology observations of plasticity. We also observe the micro-rheology of the collagen bundles. We discuss the implications of our results for cell motility via durotaxis and contact guidance. We propose that cell motility, even at low densities, is a collective effect due to mechanical communication between cells.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-06 12:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
38466,"HEP-Astro Seminar | Cosmological Constraints from Weak Gravitational Lensing Analysis of KiDS, DES, and WFIRST","In the widely accepted standard model of cosmology, the Universe is dominated by a dark sector, composed of dark matter and dark energy. A powerful technique for studying this dark sector exploits gravitational lensing, the phenomenon whereby the path of light travelling from distant galaxies (and as far away as the cosmic microwave background) is deflected by intervening mass structures along the line of sight. The lensing effect is sensitive to all matter, whether visible or dark, and can inform our understanding of the nature and evolution of the Universe. However, the amplitude of the effect is tiny and can only be detected by averaging over many galaxies. Ongoing photometric galaxy surveys such as the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) are providing the statistical power necessary to place precise constraints on the cosmological model. Much effort is also dedicated toward understanding potential sources of systematic error to ensure that the accuracy of these constraints is commensurate to their precision. I will describe the most recent cosmological lensing results from KiDS and DES and discuss some of the main challenges we face ahead of surveys that will be undertaken with future experiments such as the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST).",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-02-20 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
38468,HEP-Astro Seminar | Search for Antideuterons in Cosmic Ray Data from AMS-02 and Understanding the Deuteron/Antideuteron Production Mechanism from NA61 Data,"Detection of antideuterons produced from dark matter annihilations or decays are complementary to direct detection techniques that probe the scattering cross-sections of dark matter. Low energy antideuterons are a most interesting probe because of their ultra-low astrophysical background, the dominant source of which are the interactions between cosmic-ray protons and interstellar medium (mostly H, He). High production threshold and a steep cosmic-ray spectrum, however, ensure a low background from such processes. We search for antideuterons in cosmic-ray data recorded by Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) on board the International Space Station (ISS). Production of antideuterons and deuterons in nuclear interactions is a complex non-perturbative process. Using NA61/SHINE data (at CERN SPS) from p+p interactions with 158 GeV/c beam on liquid H target, we are working towards measurements of cross-sections of deuteron production. Comparison between cross-section measurements with predictions using models of coalescence between protons and neutrons will provide insight into the production mechanism and will help improve models. Extending the analysis techniques, measurements of antideuteron cross-sections will be helpful in limiting astrophysical background in AMS-02 data.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-04-17 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

A powerful tool to understand this matter is to use the high momentum quarks and gluons generated in hard scattering processes in the earliest stages of the nuclear collision as probes of the matter at later times.

However, the complexity of their interactions generally prevents us from coming up with an exact mathematical description of their behavior. Precisely engineered ultracold gases are emerging as a powerful tool for unraveling these challenging physical problems. In this talk, I will present recent developments at JILA on using alkaline-earth atoms (AEAs) --currently the basis of the most precise atomic clock in the world-- for the investigation of complex many-body phenomena and magnetism. I will discuss ideas to use AEAs to engineer synthetic materials with no yet known counterpart in nature.

38473,Department Colloquium | Neutrinos from Nuclear Reactors: Searches and Surprises,"Nuclear reactors are very bright sources of neutrinos. The radioactive fission products are neutron rich, and beta decay back to the valley of stability while emitting (electron anti-)neutrinos along the way. This was how the neutrino was discovered, and how we verified that neutrino oscillations explained the Solar Neutrino Problem. More recently, the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment discovered a new mode of neutrino oscillation, and the PROSPECT experiment is being planned to search for “sterile” neutrinos. This talk will first review the basics of neutrinos, their detection, neutrino oscillations, and nuclear reactors as neutrino sources. We’ll then take a tour of recent results and next steps, including some surprises in what we’ve learned about the reactor neutrino source itself.

38474,Department Colloquium | Ford Distinguished Lecture in Physics,"Learn about new developments in the study of supermassive black holes. Through the capture and analysis of twenty years of high-resolution imaging, the UCLA Galactic Center Group has moved the case for a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy from a possibility to a certainty. This was made possible with the first measurements of stellar orbits around a galactic nucleus. Further advances in state-of-the-art of high-resolution imaging technology on the world’s largest telescopes have greatly expanded the power of using stellar orbits to study black holes. Recent observations have revealed an environment around the black hole that is quite unexpected (young stars where there should be none; a lack of old stars where there should be many; and a puzzling new class of objects). Continued measurements of the motions of stars have solved many of the puzzles posed by these perplexing populations of stars. This work is providing insight into how black holes grow and the role that they play in regulating the growth of their host galaxies. Future measurements of stellar orbits at the Galactic Center hold the promise of improving our understanding of gravity through tests of Einstein Theory of General Relativity in an unexplored regime. The reception will begin at 4:00 p.m. in the East Hall first floor north atrium, located directly behind the lecture hall, facing Church Street prior to the lecture.",Map East Hall - 1324,['2017-03-22 16:30'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
38475,Department Colloquium | Digging Into the Large Scale Structure: From the Galaxies to the Cosmic Web,"Galaxy spectroscopic surveys provide the means to map out this cosmic large-scale structure in three dimensions, furnishing a cornerstone of observational cosmology. The information is given in the form of galaxy locations, and is typically condensed into a single function of scale, such as the galaxy correlation function or power-spectrum. However, galaxy correlation functions are not the only information those surveys provide. One of the most striking features of N-body simulations is the network of filaments into which dark matter particles arrange themselves. We however traditionally only use the information contained in the positions of the galaxies, and in some occasions, we look at other cosmic structures of the Universe such as voids. In this colloquium, I explore the information beyond the galaxy positions in large sky surveys combining novel ideas with recent techniques in statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. In particular, we will investigate the following two topics: the ""cosmic web"" that are mostly ignored in any large scale structure analyses in the Universe and how it affects the surrounding galaxies; and ""likelihood free analysis"" with machine learning.",Map West Hall - 340,['2017-04-05 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

I will present the imprints on the galaxy number counts (GNC's) and on the cross-correlation of the GNC's with CMB temperature anisotropies from certain classes of scalar-tensor theories of gravity embedded in the Horndeski Lagrangian. Furthermore fundamental properties of gravity, e.g. the propagation speed of tensor perturbations, can be tested using an effective field theory approach. Due to the remarkable modifications of relativistic effects which contribute to the considered signals, like the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, these observables allow us to constrain or even rule out some alternative models.",Map Randall Laboratory - 3481,['2017-02-08 12:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

38479,HET Brown Bag Seminar | Linearized Gravity as a Gauge-Invariant Wave Equation on Kinematic Space,"Kinematic space was originally defined in AdS3 as the space of geodesics. In this talk, I will generalize the concept of kinematic space to higher dimensions. Fields can be defined on this kinematic space, and these fields can be identified with ""OPE blocks,"" contributions to the OPE from a single conformal family. In holographic theories, the OPE blocks are dual at leading order in 1/N to integrals of effective bulk fields along geodesics or homogeneous minimal surfaces in anti-de Sitter space. Thus, these operators pave the way for generalizing the Ryu-Takayanagi relation to other bulk fields. The dynamics of bulk fields are related to the dynamics of kinematic space fields via the intertwining property of integral transformations. In particular, the linearized gravitational equations are shown to be equivalent to a gauge-invariant wave equation on kinematic space.

Among several viable options, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are motivated dark matter candidates that can be tested by different and complementary search strategies. Crucially, different searches probe WIMP couplings at different energy scales, and such a separation of scales has striking consequences in connecting different experimental probes. This motivates the development of theoretical tools to properly connect the different energy scales involved in constraining WIMP models. I will introduce these tools and I will illustrate with several examples how crucial the inclusion of these effects in WIMP searches is.",Map Randall Laboratory - 3481,['2017-03-29 12:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
38481,HET Brown Bag Seminar | Linearity of Holographic Entanglement Entropy,"We consider the question of whether the leading contribution to the entanglement entropy in holographic CFTs is truly given by the expectation value of a linear operator as is suggested by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We investigate this property by computing the entanglement entropy, via the replica trick, in states dual to superpositions of macroscopically distinct geometries and find it consistent with evaluating the expectation value of the area operator within such states. However, we find that this fails once the number of semi-classical states in the superposition grows exponentially in the central charge of the CFT. Moreover, in certain such scenarios we find that the choice of surface on which to evaluate the area operator depends on the density matrix of the entire CFT. This nonlinearity is enforced in the bulk via the homology prescription of Ryu-Takayanagi. We thus conclude that the homology constraint is not a linear property in the CFT.",Map Randall Laboratory - 3481,['2017-04-05 12:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

In two recent papers, observations of Hawking radiation in rubidium condensates have been reported. The first attributed the observed features to the ""black hole laser"" effect, while the second reported measurements of the quantum entanglement of Hawking phonons with their partners. I'll explain this circle of ideas, describe the experiments, and report on theoretical analyses showing that, in fact, the laser effect was most likely not behind the observations, and that more work is needed to determine whether the measurements actually demonstrated entanglement.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-10 15:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

We examine an alternative possibility that the mass of FDM is generated by infrared confining dynamics, in analogy with the QCD axion. We find that cosmological constraints are suggestive of a period of mild of inflation that reheats the Standard Model (SM) sector only. A typical prediction of the scenario, broadly speaking, is a larger effective number of neutrinos compared to the SM value Neff≈3, as inferred from precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background. Some of the new degrees of freedom may be identified as ""sterile neutrinos,"" which may be required to explain certain neutrino oscillation anomalies.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-03-31 15:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

There has been great interest in recent years in dark sectors containing both dark matter and much lighter particles; as the LHC continues to constrain low-scale supersymmetry, even classic weakly interacting dark matter candidates may need to be heavy relative to the weak gauge bosons. I will describe recent work to characterize the novel properties of heavy dark matter coupled to light force carriers, in two principal directions: (1) the precision calculation of heavy wino dark matter annihilation to line photons using effective field theory, now to NLL’ order, and (2) the properties of dark-sector bound states where multiple force carriers and several states in a dark matter multiplet may be involved, using the wino as an example.

38625,CM Theory Seminar | Tensor Network Methods for Electronic Structure,"Our conventional picture of wave functions living in an exponentially large Hilbert space is both impractical for solving many particle systems and conceptually lacking: in recent years we have come to understand that physical states of matter live in an infinitesimal corner of Hilbert space, characterized primarily by low entanglement. Tensor networks are the natural language to express low entanglement wave functions, giving an exponentially compressed description of ground states. The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and other tensor network algorithms have had tremendous success in simulating quantum lattice models. The key challenge in translating these methods to electronic structure is the need to represent continuum space in an efficient way. After an introduction to tensor networks, I’ll present a new DMRG-based approach suitable for the electronic structure of long molecules. Our sliced-basis DMRG method produces near-exact ground states within its basis, and has a computation time which is linear in the length of the molecule. We are implementing SBDMRG for chains of hydrogen atoms, where we have been able to simulate up to 1000 atoms in a minimal basis.",Map West Hall - 340,['2017-02-14 15:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

These results have recently been confirmed by a group from the Australian National University, and the Munich group has also discovered supernova Iron 60 in lunar rock samples and in microfossils of magnetotactic bacteria.

Precision knowledge about nucleons is becoming increasingly critical to either determine Standard-Model backgrounds or to interpret the signatures predicted for particles beyond the Standard Model. Lattice QCD is an ideal theoretical method to for determining these nonperturbative QCD quantities. In this talk, I will review the progress and prospects for lattice QCD as a bridge between theory and precision experiments. In the first part, I discuss how we overcame a long-standing obstacle, and for the first time in lattice-QCD, were able to directly calculate the Bjorken-x dependence of the parton distribution functions (PDFs). This breakthrough opens an exciting new frontier to improve the dominant uncertainty in the global analysis of PDFs used in Higgs production cross sections. Then, I discuss how lattice nucleon coupling calculations are now entering a precision era, where calculations are done at the physical pion mass with fully controlled systematics. This was first achieved by the Precision Neutron-Decay Matrix Element (PNDME) collaboration. PNDME’s high-quality precision nucleon inputs can be applied to searches for new physics; I give examples for neutron beta decay and the neutron electric dipole moment.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-02-13 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"
38630,CM Theory Seminar | Programmable Matter: Using 3D Printed Elastic Instabilities to Direct Shape Transformation,"3D printed programmable matter has the potential to revolutionize manufacturing in fields ranging from organs-on-a-chip to architecture to soft robotics. By expanding the pallet of 3D printable materials to include the use stimuli responsive inks, this nascent 3D printing technique promises precise control over patterned shape transformations. With the goal of creating a new manufacturing technique, we have recently introduced a biomimetic printing platform that enables the direct control of local anisotropy into both the elastic moduli and the swelling response of the ink. We have drawn inspiration from nastic plant movements to design a phytomimetic ink and printing process that enables patterned dynamic shape change upon exposure to water, and possibly other external stimuli. Our novel fiber-reinforced hydrogel ink enables local control over anisotropies not only in the elastic moduli, but more importantly in the swelling. Upon hydration, the hydrogel changes shape according the arbitrarily complex microstructure imparted during the printing process. To use this process as a design tool, we must solve the inverse problem of prescribing the pattern of anisotropies required to generate a given curved target structure. We show how to do this by constructing a theory of anisotropic plates and shells that can respond to local metric changes induced by anisotropic swelling. A series of experiments corroborate our model by producing a range of target shapes inspired by the morphological diversity of flower petals.",Map West Hall - 335,['2017-02-10 12:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

Taking Lillian Smith’s Strange Fruit and Richard Wright’s Black Boy, both published in 1944, as case studies and expanding out, Dr. Gardner argues that during the 1940s the South came to occupy a different literary position in the minds of industry insiders. The war changed which books were produced, how they were produced, and the ways they were pitched to an expanding market that demanded reading material that explained new wartime realities. In this climate, few southern titles fit the bill. It also notes the ways in which the industry itself had changed. Southerners continued to publish fiction, of course, but by the 1940s there was hardly anything new about the overturning of the moonlight and magnolia school of southern letters. Renaissances cannot continue forever. Southern authors still might have something new to say, but that was no longer revolutionary. The modern literary marketplace that had emerged in the 1920s and 1930s looked markedly different in the 1940s and 1950s. The war might not have signaled the death of Dixie, as some prognosticators had suggested, but it did signal the death of the southern literary renaissance.",Map East Quadrangle - Residential College Keene Theater,['2017-03-06 15:10'],"['African american', 'Books', 'Culture', 'Discussion', 'Free', 'History', 'Language', 'Lecture', 'Literature', 'Multicultural', 'Scholarship']"

38710,UM Psychology Community Talk with Dr. David Dunning,"Title: The Long and Winding Road to Knowing Thyself: Why Accurate Self-Knowledge is So Difficult to Achieve “Know thyself!” exhorted the ancient Greeks, but it turns out that accurate self-understanding is difficult to gain, particularly when it comes to evaluating our knowledge and expertise. I discuss recent psychology research showing common biases people display when judging their skill and know-how, the costs (and occasional benefits) of those biases, as well as describe best practices to potentially avoid them. It all boils down to following this wise, old admonishment: When arguing with a fool, just make sure that the other person is not likewise engaged. David Dunning is Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan and Faculty Affiliate of the Research Center for Group Dynamics at the Institute of Social Research. He taught for several years at Cornell University, where he is Professor Emeritus. An author, co-author, or co-editor of nearly 150 journal articles, book chapters, commentaries, and reviews, he has served as president of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology and the Society for the Study of Motivation. He received the 2016 Award for Lifetime Achievement from the International Society for Self and Identity, and has written articles for the Chronicle of Higher Education, Politico, Quartz, Pacific Standard, Scientific American MIND, and the Guardian (UK). His work has been funded by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the Templeton Foundation, as well as featured in more popular outlets as diverse as the New York Times, This American Life, and Doonesbury.",Ann Arbor Public Library - Basement,['2017-04-17 19:00'],"['Community service', 'Free', 'Psychology']"

Each work relies on a different experiment with generative pattern, and all have been realized using the Abjad API for Formalized Score Control, an extension of the widely-used Python programming language that enables composers to create scores via an object-oriented model of common practice western music notation. In this presentation, I demonstrate my code-based compositional process and describe the generative mechanisms underlying my work, which range from historical composition techniques--such as prolation canon and arpeggiation based on harmonic verticalities--to novel conceptual experiments, such as metaphors of rhythmic noise and melodic nesting via search algorithms. I place these abstract materials and developmental strategies in discourse with the instrument’s relatively more concrete physical and timbral restrictions, to frame the tension between abstract pattern and listened or performed physicality as a restorative force in my compositional practice.”",Map Earl V.

38929,CM Theory Seminar | Hopping Harmonics and Entangled Wave Patterns: Adaptivity and Functionality Boosting in Metamaterial Architectures,"Mechanical metamaterials and phononic crystals are examples of architected materials that owe their unique dynamic properties to an intelligent spatial arrangement of their internal network of constitutive elements. These material systems display a variety of exotic wave manipulation properties, which include the formation of bandgaps, frequency-dependent wave anisotropy, waveguiding and cloaking. One of the main challenges in the design of metamaterial systems is endowing them with tunable and adaptive capabilities. Tunability is the ability to modify a system's response through the control of some external parameters, in order to tune it to evolving operating conditions. A system displays adaptivity when it can spontaneously modify its response in reaction to sensed changes in the characteristics of the applied excitation. These properties provide versatility and grant the material the possibility to work far from its ideal design points. The opportunities are especially broad in the realm of wave control, in light of the inherent ability of metamaterial architectures to experience directional (anisotropic) wave propagation. In this context, tunability implies being able to switch on and off certain directional wave characteristics and to control the pattern of the wave paths along which the energy travels in the solid. It also allows augmenting the range of functionalities that it is possible to activate by exciting the system at a given frequency. This presentation provides an overview of the wave manipulation capabilities of mechanical metamaterials and phononic crystals and introduces a strategy for tunability and adaptivity that exploits the nonlinearity of the system’s response as the main tuning mechanism. The idea is based on a new outlook on the phenomenon of higher harmonic generation, which is revisited in the context of periodic structures characterized by pronounced modal complexity. We show how, by simply, playing with the amplitude of excitation, it is possible to switch on new features in the nonlinear wave response, thus augmenting the wave directivity landscape and enhancing the overall functionalities of the medium.

Science and Technology employers know that with a physics training, a potential hire has acquired a broad problem-solving skill set that translates to almost any environment, as well as an ability to be self-guided and -motivated so that they can teach themselves whatever is needed to be successful at achieving their goals. Therefore it’s no surprise that the majority of physics graduates find employment in private--sector, industrial settings. At the same time, only about 25% of graduating PhDs will take a permanent faculty position--yet academic careers are usually the only track to which students are exposed while earning their degrees.

The heavier CP-even Higgs H is the 125 GeV Higgs boson discovered at the LHC. The model admits two options for describing the dimuon excess: (1) The lighter CP-even Higgs h and the CP-odd state ηA are approximately degenerate and contribute to the 30 GeV excess. (2) Only the h is at 30 GeV while the ηA and H are approximately degenerate at 125 GeV. The ALEPH data favor option 1.

39107,Ernestine Ruben at Willow Run,"In 2013, artist Ernestine Ruben (BSDEs ’53) photographed the once-famed industrial complex Willow Run in Washtenaw County, Michigan. Designed by her grandfather, Detroit architect Albert Kahn, for the Ford Motor Company, Willow Run was an exemplar of American defense manufacturing because of its efficient mass-production of B-24 Liberators during World War II. For this exhibition, Ruben overlaid interior views of the now-dormant factory with imagined glimpses into her body’s interior landscape. The resulting compositions seem to breathe energy and light into the stagnant and cavernous spaces of Willow Run and suggest a longing for a productive existence undeterred by mortality for both Willow Run and the artist. Her grandfather’s role in the history of the site underscores Ruben’s personal connection. The exhibition presents Ruben’s photographs of Willow Run in UMMA’s Photography Gallery and an original film—co-created by Ruben and video artist Seth Bernstein and featuring an original score by award-winning composer Stephen Hartke—in the Museum’s Forum. Lead support for Ernestine Ruben at Willow Run: Mobilizing Memory is provided by the University of Michigan Office of the Provost and the Herbert W. and Susan L.

Most of these projects are part of Senior Design Project Courses, but other project groups are welcome and encouraged to participate. The goal of the Undergraduate Engineering Office is to have participation from all departments within the College of Engineering (and eventually across university schools and colleges) to promote cross-disciplinary cooperation as well as high-school outreach. Industry sponsors, have been a large part of promoting this within the college through sponsorship of projects and as well as monetary support of the event itself.

After years of silence regarding the suicide deaths of his brothers, Dennis shares his story of survival.

The numbers for completed suicides are heading in the wrong direction and a call to action is needed. Dennis can deliver that call and the audience will respond. COACH Dennis is a part-time lacrosse coach for his local high school and a full-time fanatic for the sport. Dennis has a special ability to connect with these kids through coaching and it shows in his public speaking. Motivating an audience of any age or size is no problem and his message is simple – life is worth living.

The conference will begin on Thursday, March 30, at 4:15 PM with a keynote session commemorating the 30-year history of the Environmental Crimes Section at the Justice Department. This panel discussion will feature the eight prosecutors who have served as Chief of the Environmental Crimes Section: Jud Starr (1987-1989), Jerry Block (1989-1991), Neil Cartusciello (1991-1994), Ron Sarachan (1994-1997), Steve Solow (1997-2000), David Uhlmann (2000-2007), Stacey Mitchell (2007-2014), and Deborah Harris (2014-present). Their discussion will provide an overview of criminal enforcement under the environmental laws from the Exxon Valdez, Colonial Pipeline, and Koch Petroleum to the Gulf oil spill, Volkswagen, and Lumber Liquidators, along with hundreds of other cases prosecuted over the last 30 years. The conference will continue on Friday, March 31. We will begin the morning with a panel discussion about the role of criminal enforcement in environmental and worker safety disasters, with a focus on the Gulf oil spill and the Upper Big Branch mine disaster. Environmental prosecutors often focus on cases where the harm is greatest but those cases also raise questions about whether criminal prosecution is appropriate for industrial accidents. Our second panel of the morning will focus on fraud and concealment, with a focus on the recent prosecution of Volkswagen and the use of Title 18 charges generally. During lunch we will feature breakout discussions in two recurring areas of environmental criminal enforcement: pipeline safety issues (with an emphasis on the 2010 Enbridge oil spill in the Kalamazoo River) and international smuggling cases (with a focus on the 2016 prosecution of Lumber Liquidators for importing illegally seized hardwoods from Asia). These smaller breakout sessions will give conference participants a greater opportunity to join the discussions. Our conference will conclude with a panel discussion about the criminal prosecution of state and local officials for the Flint drinking water crisis. We will explore the extent to which residents of Flint, Michigan were betrayed by their state and municipal governments–as well as the difficult question of under what circumstances government officials should face criminal charges. Our moderators are University of Michigan law professors who are joined by panelists that include academics, prosecutors, and defense attorneys from throughout the United States who are leading experts on environmental crime.

39632,Biopsychology Colloquium Talk - Caught in peculiar positions: Variation in the mechanisms of monogamy,"ABSTRACT: Individual variation in social behavior seems ubiquitous, but we know little about how it relates to brain diversity. Among monogamous prairie voles, vasopressin receptor (avpr1a) levels in brain regions related to spatial memory predict male space-use and sexual fidelity in the field. We find that trade-offs between the benefits of male fidelity and infidelity are reflected in patterns of territorial intrusion, offspring paternity, avpr1a expression and the evolutionary fitness of alternative avpr1a alleles. DNA variation at the avpr1a locus includes polymorphisms that reliably predict the epigenetic status and neural expression of avpr1a, while patterns of DNA diversity demonstrate avpr1a regulatory variation has been favored by selection. In prairie voles, trade-offs in the fitness consequences of social behaviors seem to promote neuronal and molecular diversity.",Map East Hall - 4464,['2017-03-21 12:00'],"['Biology', 'Colloquium', 'Free', 'Psychology']"

Recently we carried out a comprehensive simulation study of the phase behavior near the melting transition of all hard regular polygons with 3 ≤ n ≤ 14 vertices using massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations of up to one million particles. By investigating this family of shapes, we can show that the melting transition depends upon both particle shape and symmetry considerations, which together can predict which of three different melting scenarios will occur for a given n.",Map West Hall - 340,['2017-03-29 16:00'],"['Culture', 'Free', 'Graduate', 'Lecture', 'Physics', 'Science', 'Talk', 'Undergraduate']"

40115,"Musicology Lecture: Dr. Joy H. Calico, Vanderbilt University","On 31 March 1913 Arnold Schoenberg conducted a concert in the Great Hall of Vienna’s Musikverein that would become known as that city’s most notorious scandal concert. The event was broken up by a melee, charges were filed, and the subsequent court proceedings were reported in the press. This paper analyzes the ways in which both the scandal and Schoenberg’s response to it sit at the nexus of fin-de-siècle anxieties about Central European concert life, the anti-noise movement, and emerging copyright law. *There is limited seating for this event, so arriving early is suggested*",Map Earl V.

The format for the event will be short presentations from each company, followed by a pitch contest challenge around a topic in the food industry, and an informal question and answer session with the speakers. Dinner will be provided - Vic and Barb's will be catering the event.

I will then give an overview of my STEM education initiatives in South America, in particular, my work with a Peruvian no for profit organization whose mission is to implement fully inclusive innovative education STEM projects for students in Peru. I will then talk about my transition into science policy as a first year AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow in the Division of Undergraduate Education at the National Science Foundation. I will highlight my work investigating institutional efforts to transform teaching and learning in STEM fields into environments that support and scale-up evidence-based teaching and learning practices across all STEM departments. I will also talk about some of my own projects, ranging from science diplomacy to regional food systems for sustainable food production and consumption.
